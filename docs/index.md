A framework for multi-agent review workflows using large language models.

## Overview

LatteReview is a Python framework that enables you to create and manage multi-agent review workflows using various large language models. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for implementing different types of review processes, from simple single-agent reviews to complex multi-stage workflows with multiple agents.

## Features

- Support for multiple review rounds with hierarchical decision-making workflows
- Review diverse content types including article titles, abstracts, custom texts, and images using LLM-powered reviewer agents
- Define reviewer agents with specialized backgrounds and distinct evaluation capabilities
- Create flexible review workflows where multiple agents operate in parallel or sequential arrangements
- Enable reviewer agents to analyze peer feedback, cast votes, and propose corrections to other reviewers' assessments
- Enhance reviews with item-specific context integration, supporting use cases like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Broad compatibility with LLM providers through LiteLLM, including OpenAI and Ollama
- Model-agnostic integration supporting OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Groq, and local models via Ollama
- High-performance asynchronous processing for efficient batch reviews
- Standardized output format featuring detailed scoring metrics and reasoning transparency
- Robust cost tracking and memory management systems
