      "        Abstract: This study proposes a novel, integrative framework for patient-centered data science in the digital health era. We developed a multidimensional model that combines traditional clinical data with patient-reported outcomes, social determinants of health, and multi-omic data to create comprehensive digital patient representations. Our framework employs a multi-agent artificial intelligence approach, utilizing various machine learning techniques including large language models, to analyze complex, longitudinal datasets. The model aims to optimize multiple patient outcomes simultaneously while addressing biases and ensuring generalizability. We demonstrate how this framework can be implemented to create a learning healthcare system that continuously refines strategies for optimal patient care. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the translation of digital health innovations into real-world clinical benefits, addressing current limitations in AI-driven healthcare models.\n",

As the complexity of agent-based models (ABMs) increase, the number of parameters required to be calibrated grows. This leads to the ABMS equivalent of the “curse of dimensionality”. We propose an ABMS framework which facilitates the effective integration of different sampling methods and surrogate models (SMs) in order to evaluate how these strategies affect parameter calibration and exploration. We show that surrogate assisted methods perform better than the standard sampling methods. In addition, we show that the XGBoost and Decision Tree SMs are most optimal overall with regards to our analysis.\n",

To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody.

      "        Abstract: Background Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as versatile tools in healthcare, demonstrating the ability to regurgitate clinical knowledge and pass medical licensing exams. Despite their promise, they have been largely treated as slow, imperfect information retrieval tools and face limitations such as data staleness, resource intensity, and manufacturing incorrect text - reducing their applicability to dynamic healthcare settings. Methods This study explored the functionality of both proprietary and open-source LLMs to act as autonomous agents within a simulated tertiary care medical center. Real-world clinical cases across multiple specialties were structured into JSON files and presented to agents for solution using the resources available to a human physician. Agents were created using LLMs in combination with natural language prompts, tools with real-world interactions, and standard programming techniques. The technique of Retrieval Augmented Generation was used to provide agents with updated context whenever appropriate. Expert clinicians collected and evaluated model responses across several performance metrics including correctness of the final answer, judicious use of tools, guideline conformity, and resistance to hallucinations. Findings Agents showed varied performance across specialties, with proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) generally outperforming open-source models. The use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improved guideline adherence and contextually relevant responses for the best performing model. Interpretation LLMs can effectively function as autonomous agents in healthcare by leveraging their generative capabilities and integrating with real-world data. The study highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making in clinical settings through tailored prompts and retrieval tools. However, the variability in model performance and the necessity for ongoing manual evaluation suggest that further refinements in LLM technology and operational protocols are needed to optimize their utility in healthcare.\n",

      "        Abstract: The footprint left by early cancer dynamics on the spatial arrangement of tumour cells is poorly understood, and yet could encode information about how therapy resistant sub-clones grew within the expanding tumour. Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population mixing. First, using a toy model of cell mixing we demonstrate how first passage time statistics can distinguish between different pattern structures. We then apply our method to simulated patterns of wild-type and mutated tumour cell population mixing, generated using an agent-based model of expanding tumours, to explore how first passage times reflect mutant cell replicative advantage, time of emergence and strength of cell pushing. Finally, we analyse experimentally measured patterns of genetic point mutations in human colorectal cancer, and estimate parameters of early sub-clonal dynamics using our spatial computational model. We uncover a wide range of mutant cell replicative advantages and timings, with the majority of sampled tumours consistent with boundary driven growth or short-range cell pushing. By analysing multiple sub-sampled regions in a small number of samples, we explore how the distribution of inferred dynamics could inform about the initial mutational event. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of first passage time analysis as a new methodology for quantifying cell mixing patterns in vivo, and suggest that patterns of sub-clonal mixing can provide insights into early cancer dynamics.\n",

      "        Abstract: The highest grossing media franchise of all times, with over $90 billion in total revenue, is Pokémon. The video games belong to the class of Japanese Role Playing Games (J-RPG). Developing a powerful AI agent for these games is very hard because they present big challenges to MinMax, Monte Carlo Tree Search and statistical Machine Learning, as they are vastly different from the well explored in AI literature games. An AI agent for one of these games means significant progress in AI agents for the entire class. Further, the key principles of such work can hopefully inspire approaches to several domains that require excellent teamwork under conditions of extreme uncertainty, including managing a team of doctors, robots or employees in an ever changing environment, like a pandemic stricken region or a war-zone. In this paper we first explain the mechanics of the game and we perform a game analysis. We continue by proposing unique AI algorithms based on our understanding that the two biggest challenges in the game are keeping a balanced team and dealing with three sources of uncertainty. Later on, we describe why evaluating the performance of such agents is challenging and we present the results of our approach. Our AI agent performed significantly better than all previous attempts and peaked at the 33rd place in the world, in one of the most popular battle formats, while running on only 4 single socket servers.\n",

      "        Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are increasingly applied to predicting the development of sepsis and multiple organ failure. While there has been success in demonstrating the clinical utility of such systems in terms of affecting various outcomes, there are fundamental challenges to the ML/AI approach in terms of improving the actual predictive performance and future robustness of such systems. Given that one of the primary proposed avenues for improving algorithmic performance is the addition of molecular/biomarker/genetic features to the data used to train these systems, the overall sparsity of such available data suggests the need to generate synthetic data to aid in training, as has been the case in numerous other ML/AI tasks, such as image recognition/generation and text analysis/generation. We propose the need to generate synthetic molecular/mediator time series data coincides with the advent of the concept of medical digital twins, specifically related to interpretations of medical digital twins that hew closely to the original description and use of industrial digital twins, which involve simulating multiple individual twins from a common computational model specification. Herein we present an example of generating synthetic time series data of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines using the Critical Illness Digital Twin (CIDT) regarding the development of post-traumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n",

For supervised learning without universally valid ground truth, a recommended approach is applying crowdsourcing: Gathering a large data set annotated by multiple individuals of varying possibly expertise levels and inferring the ground truth data to be used as labels to train the classifier. Nevertheless, due to the sensitivity of the problem at hand (e.g. mitosis detection in breast cancer histology images), the obtained data needs verification and proper assessment before being used for classifier training. Even in the context of organic computing systems, an indisputable ground truth might not always exist. Therefore, it should be inferred through the aggregation and verification of the local knowledge of each autonomous agent.\n",

      "        Abstract: Agent Based Models are very popular in a number of different areas. For example, they have been used in a range of domains ranging from modeling of tumor growth, immune systems, molecules to models of social networks, crowds and computer and mobile self-organizing networks. One reason for their success is their intuitiveness and similarity to human cognition. However, with this power of abstraction, in spite of being easily applicable to such a wide number of domains, it is hard to validate agent-based models. In addition, building valid and credible simulations is not just a challenging task but also a crucial exercise to ensure that what we are modeling is, at some level of abstraction, a model of our conceptual system; the system that we have in mind. In this paper, we address this important area of validation of agent based models by presenting a novel technique which has broad applicability and can be applied to all kinds of agent-based models. We present a framework, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system can be used to validate simulation models. In addition, since agent-based models have been typically growing, in parallel, in multiple domains, to cater for all of these, we present a new single validation technique applicable to all agent based models. Our technique, which allows for the validation of agent based simulations uses VOMAS: a Virtual Overlay Multi-agent System. This overlay multi-agent system can comprise various types of agents, which form an overlay on top of the agent based simulation model that needs to be validated. Other than being able to watch and log, each of these agents contains clearly defined constraints, which, if violated, can be logged in real time. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show its broad applicability in a wide variety of simulation models ranging from social sciences to computer networks in spatial and non-spatial conceptual models.\n",
