      "        Abstract: The recently emerged molecular communication (MC) paradigm intends to leverage communication engineering tools for the design of synthetic chemical communication systems. These systems are envisioned to operate at nanoscale and in biological environments, such as the human body, and catalyze the emergence of revolutionary applications in the context of early disease monitoring and drug targeting. Despite the abundance of theoretical (and recently also experimental) MC system designs proposed over the past years, some fundamental questions remain unresolved, hindering the breakthrough of MC in real-world applications. One of these questions is: What can be a useful measure of information in the context of MC applications? While most existing works on MC build upon the concept of syntactic information as introduced by Shannon, in this paper, we explore the framework of semantic information as introduced by Kolchinsky and Wolpert for the information-theoretic analysis of a natural MC system, namely bacterial chemotaxis. Exploiting computational agent-based modeling (ABM), we are able to quantify, for the first time, the amount of information that the considered chemotactic bacterium (CB) utilizes to adapt to and survive in a dynamic environment. In other words, we show how the flow of information between the environment and the CB is related to the effectiveness of communication. Effectiveness here refers to the adaptation of the CB to the dynamic environment in order to ensure survival. Our analysis reveals that it highly depends on the environmental conditions how much information the CB can effectively utilize for improving their survival chances. Encouraged by our results, we envision that the proposed semantic information framework can open new avenues for the development of theoretical and experimental MC system designs for future nanoscale applications.\n",

      "        Abstract: CT imaging works by reconstructing an object of interest from a collection of projections. Traditional methods such as filtered-back projection (FBP) work on projection images acquired around a fixed rotation axis. However, for some CT problems, it is desirable to perform a joint reconstruction from projection data acquired from multiple rotation axes. In this paper, we present Multi-Pose Fusion, a novel algorithm that performs a joint tomographic reconstruction from CT scans acquired from multiple poses of a single object, where each pose has a distinct rotation axis. Our approach uses multi-agent consensus equilibrium (MACE), an extension of plug-and-play, as a framework for integrating projection data from different poses. We apply our method on simulated data and demonstrate that Multi-Pose Fusion can achieve a better reconstruction result than single pose reconstruction.\n",

      "        Abstract: A multiagent system is a society of autonomous agents whose interactions can be regulated via social norms. In general, the norms of a society are not hardcoded but emerge from the agents’ interactions. Specifically, how the agents in a society react to each other’s behavior and respond to the reactions of others determines which norms emerge in the society. We think of these reactions by an agent to the satisfactory or unsatisfactory behaviors of another agent as communications from the first agent to the second agent. Understanding these communications is a kind of social intelligence: these communications provide natural drivers for norm emergence by pushing agents toward certain behaviors, which can become established as norms. Whereas it is well-known that sanctioning can lead to the emergence of norms, we posit that a broader kind of social intelligence can prove more effective in promoting cooperation in a multiagent system. Accordingly, we develop Nest, a framework that models social intelligence via a wider variety of communications and understanding of them than in previous work. To evaluate Nest, we develop a simulated pandemic environment and conduct simulation experiments to compare Nest with baselines considering a combination of three kinds of social communication: sanction, tell, and hint. We find that societies formed of Nest agents achieve norms faster. Moreover, Nest agents effectively avoid undesirable consequences, which are negative sanctions and deviation from goals, and yield higher satisfaction for themselves than baseline agents despite requiring only an equivalent amount of information.\n",

      "        Abstract: In recent years, mobile robot navigation approaches have become increasingly important due to various application areas ranging from healthcare to warehouse logistics. In particular, Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches have gained popularity for robot navigation but are not easily accessible to non-experts and complex to develop. In recent years, efforts have been made to make these sophisticated approaches accessible to a wider audience. In this paper, we present Arena-Web, a web-based development and evaluation suite for developing, training, and testing DRL-based navigation planners for various robotic platforms and scenarios. The interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging to appeal to non-experts and make the technology accessible to a wider audience. With Arena-Web and its interface, training and developing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents is simplified and made easy without a single line of code.

      "        Abstract: This exercise proposes a learning mechanism to model economic agent’s decision-making process using an actor-critic structure in the literature of artificial intelligence It is motivated by the psychology literature of learning through reinforcing good or bad decisions In a model of an environment, to learn to make decisions, this AI agent needs to interact with its environment and make explorative actions Each action in a given state brings a reward signal to the agent These interactive experience is saved in the agent’s memory, which is then used to update its subjective belief of the world The agent’s decision-making strategy is formed and adjusted based on this evolving subjective belief This agent does not only take an action that it knows would bring a high reward, it also explores other possibilities This is the process of taking explorative actions, and it ensures that the agent notices changes in its environment and adapt its subjective belief and decisions accordingly Through a model of stochastic optimal growth, I illustrate that the economic agent under this proposed learning structure is adaptive to changes in an underlying stochastic process of the economy AI agents can differ in their levels of exploration, which leads to different experience in the same environment This reflects on to their different learning behaviours and welfare obtained The chosen economic structure possesses the fundamental decision making problems of macroeconomic models, i.e., how to make consumption-saving decisions in a lifetime, and it can be generalised to other decision-making processes and economic models.\n",

      "        Title: Impact of tumor-parenchyma biomechanics on liver metastatic progression: A multi-model approach\n",
      "        Abstract: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other cancers often metastasize to the liver in later stages of the disease, contributing significantly to patient death. While the biomechanical properties of the liver parenchyma (normal liver tissue) are known to affect primary and metastatic tumor growth in liver tissues, the role of these properties in driving or inhibiting metastatic inception remains poorly understood. This study uses a multi-model approach to study the effect of tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions on metastatic seeding and growth; the framework also allows investigating the impact of changing tissue biomechanics on tumor dormancy and “reawakening.” We employ a detailed poroviscoelastic (PVE) model to study how tumor metastases deform the surrounding tissue, induce pressure increases, and alter interstitial fluid flow in and near the metastases. Results from these short-time simulations in detailed single hepatic lobules motivate constitutive relations and biological hypotheses for use in an agent-based model of metastatic seeding and growth in centimeter-scale tissue over months-long time scales. We find that biomechanical tumor-parenchyma interactions on shorter time scales (adhesion, repulsion, and elastic tissue deformation over minutes) and longer time scales (plastic tissue relaxation over hours) may play a key role in tumor cell seeding and growth within liver tissue. These interactions may arrest the growth of micrometastases in a dormant state and can prevent newly arriving cancer cells from establishing successful metastatic foci. Moreover, the simulations indicate ways in which dormant tumors can “reawaken” after changes in parenchymal tissue mechanical properties, as may arise during aging or following acute liver illness or injury. We conclude that the proposed modeling approach can yield insight into the role of tumor-parenchyma biomechanics in promoting liver metastatic growth, with the longer term goal of identifying conditions to clinically arrest and reverse the course of late-stage cancer.\n",

      "        Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate human-like intelligence, making them useful in social simulations, human-machine interactions, and multi-agent systems. However, their lack of distinct personalities, such as ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform responses, limits their practical applications. Developing personalities in LLMs is essential to unlock their potential. Current methods often conduct stylized training or prompt engineering to simulate personalities, capturing only superficial styles rather than core traits, leading to instability. This study introduces PersLLM, integrating psychology-based principles of personality—social practice, consistency, and dynamic development—into a comprehensive training approach. By constructing personified data and training models, we embed personality traits into the model parameters, enhancing induction resistance, promoting consistency, and supporting dynamic evolution. Single-agent evaluations show our superiority in aligning reference responses. Multi-agent evaluations highlight improvements in opinion consistency and collaborative creativity. Human-agent interaction evaluations indicate enhancements in interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.\n",

      "        Abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major public health concern in the United States, with about 1.2 million people living with HIV and 35,000 newly infected each year. There are considerable geographical disparities in HIV burden and care access across the U.S. The 2019’Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE)’ initiative aims to reduce new infections by 90% by 2030, by improving coverage of diagnoses, treatment, and prevention interventions and prioritizing jurisdictions with high HIV prevalence. Identifying optimal scale-up of intervention combinations will help inform resource allocation. Existing HIV decision analytic models either evaluate specific cities or the overall national population, thus overlooking jurisdictional interactions or differences. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) model, that enables jurisdiction-specific decision analyses but in an environment with cross-jurisdictional epidemiological interactions. In experimental analyses, conducted on jurisdictions within California and Florida, optimal policies from MARL were significantly different than those generated from single-agent RL, highlighting the influence of jurisdictional variations and interactions. By using comprehensive modeling of HIV and formulations of state space, action space, and reward functions, this work helps demonstrate the strengths and applicability of MARL for informing public health policies, and provides a framework for expanding to the national-level to inform the EHE.\n",

This is an important step for building resilient AI systems for safety-critical applications such as automotive, finance, and healthcare. For that purpose, we propose a multi-agent system that combines both machine and human agents. In this system, a checker agent calculates a trust score of each instance (which penalizes overconfidence and overcautiousness in predictions) using an agreement-based method and ranks it; then an improver agent filters the anomalous instances based on a human rule-based procedure (which is considered safe), gets the human labels, applies geometric data augmentation, and retrains with the augmented data using transfer learning. We evaluate the system on corrupted versions of the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. We get an improvement in accuracy and trust score with just few additional labels compared to a baseline approach.\n",

      "        Abstract: Mathematical and simulation models are often used to predict the spread of a disease and estimate the impact of public health interventions, and many such models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes a study that systematically compared models for a university community, which has a much smaller but more connected population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations. All three models represented the disease progression with the same susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000 students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. Where possible, our study used parameter values from other epidemiological studies and incorporated data about COVID-19 testing in College Park, Maryland, but the study was designed to compare modeling approaches to each other using a synthetic population, so comparisons with data about actual cases were not relevant. For each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of persons who become infected over a period of 119 days (17 weeks in a semester). We evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The ABM’s computation time was much greater than the other two models’ computation time. The DCM captured some of the dynamics that were present in the ABM’s predictions and, like those from the ABM, clearly showed the importance of testing and moving classes on-line.\n",
