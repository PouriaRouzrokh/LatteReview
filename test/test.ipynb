      "        Title: Group-based Motion Prediction for Navigation in Crowded Environments\n",
      "        Abstract: We focus on the problem of planning the motion of a robot in a dynamic multiagent environment such as a pedestrian scene. Enabling the robot to navigate safely and in a socially compliant fashion in such scenes requires a representation that accounts for the unfolding multiagent dynamics. Existing approaches to this problem tend to employ microscopic models of motion prediction that reason about the individual behavior of other agents. While such models may achieve high tracking accuracy in trajectory prediction benchmarks, they often lack an understanding of the group structures unfolding in crowded scenes. Inspired by the Gestalt theory from psychology, we build a Model Predictive Control framework (G-MPC) that leverages group-based prediction for robot motion planning. We conduct an extensive simulation study involving a series of challenging navigation tasks in scenes extracted from two real-world pedestrian datasets. We illustrate that G-MPC enables a robot to achieve statistically significantly higher safety and lower number of group intrusions than a series of baselines featuring individual pedestrian motion prediction models. Finally, we show that G-MPC can handle noisy lidar-scan estimates without significant performance losses.\n",

      "        Abstract: Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in biomedical research, their clinical adoption faces significant challenges. These challenges stem from concerns about the quality, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of LLM-generated answers. Most existing work has focused on fine-tuning LLMs based on foundation models, which have not yet fully addressed accuracy and reliability issues. In this work, we propose an agent-based approach that aims to make LLM-based systems clinically deployable for precision oncology, while mitigating common pitfalls such as hallucinations, incoherence, and \"lost-in-the-middle\" problems. To achieve this, we implemented an agentic architecture, fundamentally shifting an LLM's role from a simple response synthesizer to planner. This agent orchestrates a suite of specialized tools that asynchronously retrieve information from various sources. These tools include curated document vector stores encompassing treatment guidelines, genomic data, clinical trial information, drug data, and breast cancer literature. The LLM then leverages its planning capabilities to synthesize information retrieved by these tools, generating comprehensive and accurate responses. We demonstrate GeneSilico Copilot's effectiveness in the domain of breast cancer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, the system showcases success in generating personalized oncotherapy recommendations for real-world cases.\n",

      "        Abstract: Velocity Obstacles (VO) methods form a paradigm for collision avoidance strategies among moving obstacles and agents. While VO methods perform well in simple multi-agent environments, they don’t guarantee safety and can show overly conservative behavior in common situations. In this paper, we propose to combine a VO-strategy for guidance with a CBF-approach for safety, which overcomes the overly conservative behavior of VOs and formally guarantees safety. We validate our method in a baseline comparison study, using 2nd order integrator and car-like dynamics. Results support that our method outperforms the baselines w.r.t. path smoothness, collision avoidance, and success rates.\n",

      "        Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to face hallucination issues due to the data they trained on often containing human bias; whether this is reflected in the decision-making process of LLM Agents remains under-explored. As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents’ systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents’ social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities, and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.\n",

      "        Abstract: Self-organized pattern behavior is ubiquitous throughout nature, from fish schooling to collective cell dynamics during organism development. Qualitatively these patterns display impressive consistency, yet variability inevitably exists within pattern-forming systems on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Quantifying variability and measuring pattern features can inform the underlying agent interactions and allow for predictive analyses. Nevertheless, current methods for analyzing patterns that arise from collective behavior only capture macroscopic features, or rely on either manual inspection or smoothing algorithms that lose the underlying agent-based nature of the data. Here we introduce methods based on topological data analysis and interpretable machine learning for quantifying both agentlevel features and global pattern attributes on a large scale. Because the zebrafish is a model organism for skin pattern formation, we focus specifically on analyzing its skin patterns as a means of illustrating our approach. Using a recent agent-based model, we simulate thousands of wild-type and mutant zebrafish patterns and apply our methodology to better understand pattern variability in zebrafish. Our methodology is able to quantify the differential impact of stochasticity in cell interactions on wild-type and mutant patterns, and we use our methods to predict stripe and spot statistics as a function of varying cellular communication. Our work provides a new approach to automatically quantifying biological patterns and analyzing agent-based dynamics so that we can now answer critical questions in pattern formation at a much larger scale.\n",

      "        Title: Generating synthetic multi-dimensional molecular-mediator time series data for artificial intelligence-based disease trajectory forecasting and drug development digital twins: Considerations\n",
      "        Abstract: The use of synthetic data is recognized as a crucial step in the development of neural network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While the methods for generating synthetic data for AI applications in other domains have a role in certain biomedical AI systems, primarily related to image processing, there is a critical gap in the generation of time series data for AI tasks where it is necessary to know how the system works. This is most pronounced in the ability to generate synthetic multi-dimensional molecular time series data (SMMTSD); this is the type of data that underpins research into biomarkers and mediator signatures for forecasting various diseases and is an essential component of the drug development pipeline. We argue the insufficiency of statistical and data-centric machine learning (ML) means of generating this type of synthetic data is due to a combination of factors: perpetual data sparsity due to the Curse of Dimensionality, the inapplicability of the Central Limit Theorem in terms of making assumptions about the statistical distributions of this type of data, and the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, which intrinsically limits the ability of data-centric methods to make statements about generative mechanisms that cross-scales (as is the case from cellular-molecular biology to an individual person’s state of health and disease). Alternatively, we present a rationale for using complex multi-scale mechanism-based simulation models, constructed and operated on to account for perpetual epistemic incompleteness and the need to provide maximal expansiveness in concordance with the Principle of Maximal Entropy. These procedures provide for the generation of SMMTD that minimizes the known shortcomings associated with neural network AI systems, namely overfitting and lack of generalizability. The generation of synthetic data that accounts for the identified factors of multi-dimensional time series data is an essential capability for the development of mediator-biomarker based AI forecasting systems, and therapeutic control development and optimization through systems like Drug Development Digital Twins.\n",

      "        Abstract: Robot-assisted surgical systems have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing surgical precision and minimizing human errors. However, existing systems cannot accommodate individual surgeons’ unique preferences and requirements. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries (e.g., laparoscopy) and are unsuitable for highly precise microsurgeries, such as ophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose an image-guided approach for surgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to the individual surgeon’s skill level and preferred surgical techniques during ophthalmic cataract surgery. Our approach trains reinforcement and imitation learning agents simultaneously using curriculum learning approaches guided by image data to perform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating the surgeon’s actions and preferences into the training process, our approach enables the robot to implicitly learn and adapt to the individual surgeon’s unique techniques through surgeon-in-the-loop demonstrations. This results in a more intuitive and personalized surgical experience for the surgeon while ensuring consistent performance for the autonomous robotic apprentice. We define and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated environment using our proposed metrics and highlight the trade-off between a generic agent and a surgeon-centered adapted agent. Finally, our approach has the potential to extend to other ophthalmic and microsurgical procedures, opening the door to a new generation of surgeon-in-the-loop autonomous surgical robots. We provide an open-source simulation framework for future development and reproducibility at https://github.com/amrgomaaelhady/CataractAdaptSurgRobot.\n",

      "        Abstract: The execution and runtime performance of model-based analysis tools forrealistic large-scale ABMs (Agent-Based Models) can be excessively long. Thisdue to the computational demand exponentially proportional to the model size(e.g. Population size) and the number of model parameters. Even the runtime ofa single simulation of a realistic ABM may demand huge computational resourceswhen attempting to employ realistic population size. The main aim of thisad-hoc brief report is to highlight some of surrogate models that were adequateand computationally less demanding for nonlinear dynamical models in variousmodeling application areas.To the author knowledge, these methods have beennot, at least extensively, employed for ABMs within the field of (SHCS) SocialHealth Computational Sciences, yet.

      "        Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been increasingly applied in monitoring applications because of its ability to learn from previous experiences and can make adaptive decisions. However, existing machine learning-based health monitoring applications are mostly supervised learning algorithms, trained on labels and they cannot make adaptive decisions in an uncertain complex environment. This study proposes a novel and generic system, predictive deep reinforcement learning (PDRL) with multiple RL agents in a time series forecasting environment. The proposed generic framework accommodates virtual Deep Q Network (DQN) agents to monitor predicted future states of a complex environment with a well-defined reward policy so that the agent learns existing knowledge while maximizing their rewards. In the evaluation process of the proposed framework, three DRL agents were deployed to monitor a subject’s future heart rate, respiration, and temperature predicted using a BiLSTM model. With each iteration, the three agents were able to learn the associated patterns and their cumulative rewards gradually increased. It outperformed the baseline models for all three monitoring agents. The proposed PDRL framework is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the time series forecasting process. The proposed DRL agents and deep learning model in the PDRL framework are customized to implement the transfer learning in other forecasting applications like traffic and weather and monitor their states. The PDRL framework is able to learn the future states of the traffic and weather forecasting and the cumulative rewards are gradually increasing over each episode.\n",

      "        Abstract: In the era of big data, access to abundant data is crucial for driving research forward. However, such data is often inaccessible due to privacy concerns or high costs, particularly in healthcare domain. Generating synthetic (tabular) data can address this, but existing models typically require substantial amounts of data to train effectively, contradicting our objective to solve data scarcity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic tabular data, powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By incorporating data generation process as contextual information and utilizing LLM as the optimizer, our approach significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generation in common scenarios with small sample sizes. Our experimental results on public and private datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-art models regarding generating higher quality synthetic data for downstream tasks while keeping privacy of the real data.\n",
