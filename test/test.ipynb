      "        Abstract: Reinforcement learning in cooperative multi-agent settings has recently advanced significantly in its scope, with applications in cooperative estimation for advertising, dynamic treatment regimes, distributed control, and federated learning. In this paper, we discuss the problem of cooperative multi-agent RL with function approximation, where a group of agents communicates with each other to jointly solve an episodic MDP. We demonstrate that via careful message-passing and cooperative value iteration, it is possible to achieve near-optimal no-regret learning even with a fixed constant communication budget. Next, we demonstrate that even in heterogeneous cooperative settings, it is possible to achieve Pareto-optimal no-regret learning with limited communication. Our work generalizes several ideas from the multi-agent contextual and multi-armed bandit literature to MDPs and reinforcement learning.\n",

      "        Abstract: Social media have become an integral part of our lives, expanding our interlinking capabilities to new levels. There is plenty to be said about their positive effects. On the other hand, however, some serious negative implications of social media have been repeatedly highlighted in recent years, pointing at various threats to society and its more vulnerable members, such as teenagers, in particular, ranging from much-discussed problems such as digital addiction and polarization to manipulative influences of algorithms and further to more teenager-specific issues (e.g. body stereotyping). The impact of social media – both at an individual and societal level – is characterized by the complex interplay between the users’ interactions and the intelligent components of the platform. Thus users’ understanding of social media mechanisms plays a determinant role. We thus propose a theoretical framework based on an adaptive “Social Media Virtual Companion” for educating and supporting an entire community, teenage students, to interact in social media environments in order to achieve desirable conditions, defined in terms of a community-specific and participatory designed measure of Collective Well-Being (CWB). This Companion combines automatic processing with expert intervention and guidance. The virtual Companion will be powered by a Recommender System (CWB-RS) that will optimize a CWB metric instead of engagement or platform profit, which currently largely drives recommender systems thereby disregarding any societal collateral effect. CWB-RS will optimize CWB both in the short term by balancing the level of social media threats the users are exposed to, and in the long term by adopting an Intelligent Tutor System role and enabling adaptive and personalized sequencing of playful learning activities. We put an emphasis on experts and educators in the educationally managed social media community of the Companion. They play five key roles: (a) use the Companion in classroom-based educational activities; (b) guide the definition of the CWB; (c) provide a hierarchical structure of learning strategies, objectives and activities that will support and contain the adaptive sequencing algorithms of the CWB-RS based on hierarchical reinforcement learning; (d) act as moderators of direct conflicts between the members of the community; and, finally, (e) monitor and address ethical and educational issues that are beyond the intelligent agent’s competence and control. This framework offers a possible approach to understanding how to design social media systems and embedded educational interventions that favour a more healthy and positive society. Preliminary results on the performance of the Companion’s components and studies of the educational and psychological underlying principles are presented.\n",

      "        Title: A quantitative characterization of the heterogeneous response of glioblastoma U-87 MG cell line to temozolomide\n",
      "        Abstract: Most cancers are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. This includes subpopulations of cells with different levels of sensitivity to chemotherapy, which may lead to treatment failure as the more resistant cells can survive drug treatment and continue to proliferate. While the genetic basis of resistance to many drugs is relatively well characterised, non-genetic factors are much less understood. Here we investigate the role of non-genetic, phenotypic heterogeneity in the response of glioblastoma cancer cells to the drug temozolomide (TMZ) often used to treat this type of cancer. Using a combination of live imaging, machine-learning image analysis and agent-based modelling, we show that even if all cells share the same genetic background, individual cells respond differently to TMZ. We quantitatively characterise this response by measuring the doubling time, lifespan, and motility of cells, and determine how these quantities correlate with each other as well as between the mother and daughter cell. We also show that these responses do not correlate with the cellular level of the enzyme MGMT which has been implicated in the response to TMZ.\n",

      "        Abstract: Human mobility is inextricably linked to social issues such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, and public health; however, privacy concerns restrict access to mobility data. Recently, research have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for human mobility generation, in which the challenge is how LLMs can understand individuals’ mobility behavioral differences to generate realistic trajectories conforming to real world contexts. This study handles this problem by presenting an LLM agent-based framework (MobAgent) composing two phases: understanding-based mobility pattern extraction and reasoning-based trajectory generation, which enables generate more real travel diaries at urban scale, considering different individual profiles. MobAgent extracts reasons behind specific mobility trendiness and attribute influences to provide reliable patterns; infers the relationships between contextual factors and underlying motivations of mobility; and based on the patterns and the recursive reasoning process, MobAgent finally generates more authentic and personalized mobilities that reflect both individual differences and real-world constraints. We validate our framework with 0.2 million travel survey data, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing personalized and accurate travel diaries. This study highlights the capacity of LLMs to provide detailed and sophisticated understanding of human mobility through the real-world mobility data.\n",

      "        Abstract: Predicting the future is a fantasy but practicality work. It is the key component to intelligent agents, such as self-driving vehicles, medical monitoring devices and robotics. In this work, we consider generating unseen future frames from previous observations, which is notoriously hard due to the uncertainty in frame dynamics. While recent works based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) made remarkable progress, there is still an obstacle for making accurate and realistic predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN based on inter-frame difference to circumvent the difficulties. More specifically, our model is a multi-stage generative network, which is named the Difference Guided Generative Adversarial Network (DGGAN). The DGGAN learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions that is guided by synthetic interframe difference. Given a sequence of frames, DGGAN first uses dual paths to generate meta information. One path, called Coarse Frame Generator, predicts the coarse details about future frames, and the other path, called Difference Guide Generator, generates the difference image which include complementary fine details. Then our coarse details will then be refined via guidance of difference image under the support of GANs. With this model and novel architecture, we achieve state-of-theart performance for future video prediction on UCF-101, KITTI.\n",

      "        Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn by encouraging behaviours which maximize their total reward, usually provided by the environment. In many environments, however, the reward is provided after a series of actions rather than each single action, leading the agent to experience ambiguity in terms of whether those actions are effective, an issue known as the credit assignment problem. In this paper, we propose two strategies inspired by behavioural psychology to enable the agent to intrinsically estimate more informative reward values for actions with no reward. The first strategy, called self-punishment (SP), discourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal states. The second strategy, called the rewards backfill (RB), backpropagates the rewards between two rewarded actions. We prove that, under certain assumptions and regardless of the reinforcement learning algorithm used, these two strategies maintain the order of policies in the space of all possible policies in terms of their total reward, and, by extension, maintain the optimal policy. Hence, our proposed strategies integrate with any reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through experience. We incorporated these two strategies into three popular deep reinforcement learning approaches and evaluated the results on thirty Atari games. After parameter tuning, our results indicate that the proposed strategies improve the tested methods in over 65 percent of tested games by up to over 25 times performance improvement.\n",

      "        Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications in cloud root cause analysis (RCA) have been actively explored recently. However, current methods are still reliant on manual workflow settings and do not unleash LLMs' decision-making and environment interaction capabilities. We present RCAgent, a tool-augmented LLM autonomous agent framework for practical and privacy-aware industrial RCA usage. Running on an internally deployed model rather than GPT families, RCAgent is capable of free-form data collection and comprehensive analysis with tools. Our framework combines a variety of enhancements, including a unique Self-Consistency for action trajectories, and a suite of methods for context management, stabilization, and importing domain knowledge. Our experiments show RCAgent's evident and consistent superiority over ReAct across all aspects of RCA-predicting root causes, solutions, evidence, and responsibilities-and tasks covered or uncovered by current rules, as validated by both automated metrics and human evaluations. Furthermore, RCAgent has already been integrated into the diagnosis and issue discovery workflow of the Real-time Compute Platform for Apache Flink of Alibaba Cloud.\n",

      "        Abstract: In this paper we propose a trust model to be used into a hypothetical mixed environment where humans and unmanned vehicles cooperate. We address the inclusion of emotions inside a trust model in a coherent way to the practical approaches to the current psychology theories. The most innovative contribution is how privacy issues play a role in the cooperation decisions of the emotional trust model. Both, emotions and trust have been cognitively modeled and managed with the Beliefs, Desires and Intentions (BDI) paradigm into autonomous agents implemented in GAML (the programming language of GAMA agent platform) that communicates using the IEEE FIPA standard. The trusting behaviour of these emotional agents is tested in a cooperative logistics problem where: agents have to move objects to destinations and some of the objects and places have privacy issues. The execution of simulations of this logistic problem shows how emotions and trust contribute to improve the performance of agents in terms of both, time savings and privacy protection.\n",

Our model accounts for the effects of a structured belief system, self-appraisal, internal biases, and various sources of cognitive dissonance posited by recent theories in social psychology. We prove that agents become opinionated as a consequence of a bifurcation. We analyze how the balance of social network effects in the model controls the nature of the bifurcation and, therefore, the belief-forming limit-set solutions. Our analysis provides constructive conditions on how multi-stable network belief equilibria and belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the communication network graph and belief system network graph. Our model and analysis provide new theoretical insights on the dynamics of social systems and a new principled framework for designing decentralized decision-making on engineered networks in the presence of structured relationships among alternatives.\n",
