      "        Title: Agent Hospital: A Simulacrum of Hospital with Evolvable Medical Agents\n",
      "        Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital that simulates the entire process of treating illness. All patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical scenarios.\n",

The abstract highlights the use of LLMs to simulate disease onset and progression and to improve the treatment performance of doctor agents. However, there is no explicit mention of medical imaging data or its analysis in the title or abstract. Pouria's reasoning points out this absence and acknowledges that while the article discusses LLMs in medical scenarios, it does not specifically address medical imaging data. Bardia acknowledges the focus on LLMs in a simulated hospital but also notes the lack of specific mention of medical imaging data. Given the task of evaluating whether the article discusses LLM-based AI agents applied to medical imaging data, Pouria's assessment that it does not meet this criterion is more aligned with the content provided. Therefore, I agree with Pouria's score of 1, as the article does not explicitly discuss medical imaging data.\", 'score': 1}\n",

      "        Title: Multi-level adaptation of distributed decision-making agents in complex task environments\n",
      "        Abstract: To solve complex tasks, individuals often autonomously organize in teams. Examples of complex tasks include disaster relief rescue operations or project development in consulting. The teams that work on such tasks are adaptive at multiple levels: First, by autonomously choosing the individuals that jointly perform a specific task, the team itself adapts to the complex task at hand, whereby the composition of teams might change over time. We refer to this process as self-organization. Second, the members of a team adapt to the complex task environment by learning. There is, however, a lack of extensive research on multi-level adaptation processes that consider self-organization and individual learning as simultaneous processes in the field of management science. We introduce an agent-based model based on the NK-framework to study the effects of simultaneous multi-level adaptation on a team’s performance. We implement the multi-level adaptation process by a second-price auction mechanism for self-organization at the team level. Adaptation at the individual level follows an autonomous learning mechanism. Our preliminary results suggest that, depending on the task’s complexity, different configurations of individual and collective adaptation can be associated with higher overall task performance. Low complex tasks favour high individual and collective adaptation, while moderate individual and collective adaptation is associated with better performance in case of moderately complex tasks. For highly complex tasks, the results suggest that collective adaptation is harmful to performance.\n",

      "        Abstract: In this work, we use a simple multi-agent-based model (MABM), implementing selfish algorithm (SA) agents, to create an adaptive environment and show, using modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA), that the mutual-adaptive interaction between the parts of such a network manifests complexity synchronization (CS). CS has been experimentally shown to exist among organ-networks (ONs) of the brain (neurophysiology), lungs (respiration), and heart (cardiovascular reactivity) and to be explained theoretically as a synchronization of the multifractal scaling parameters characterizing each time series. Herein, we find the same kind of CS in the emergent intelligence (i.e., without macroscopic control and based on self-interest) between two groups of agents playing an anti-coordination game, thereby suggesting the potential for the same CS in real-world social phenomena and in human-machine interactions.\n",

      "        Title: Perimeter Control with Heterogeneous Metering Rates for Cordon Signals: A Physics-Regularized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach\n",
      "        Abstract: Perimeter Control (PC) strategies have been proposed to address urban road network control in oversaturated situations by regulating the transfer flow of the Protected Network (PN) based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in most existing studies overlooks the variance of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may cause severe local traffic congestion and degradation of the network stability. PC strategies with heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals allow precise control for the perimeter but the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the scale of the PN. This paper leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based traffic signal control framework to decompose this PC problem, which considers heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals, into multi-agent cooperation tasks. Each agent controls an individual signal located in the cordon, decreasing the dimension of action space for the controller compared to centralized methods. A physics regularization approach for the MARL framework is proposed to ensure the distributed cordon signal controllers are aware of the global network state by encoding MFD-based knowledge into the action-value functions of the local agents. The proposed PC strategy is operated as a two-stage system, with a feedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and then distributing local instructions to cordon signals controllers in the MARL framework via the physics regularization. Through numerical tests with different demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PC strategy shows promising robustness and transferability. It outperforms state-of-the-art feedback PC strategies in increasing network throughput, decreasing distributed delay for gate links, and reducing carbon emissions.\n",

      "        Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are increasingly applied to predicting the development of sepsis and multiple organ failure. While there has been success in demonstrating the clinical utility of such systems in terms of affecting various outcomes, there are fundamental challenges to the ML/AI approach in terms of improving the actual predictive performance and future robustness of such systems. Given that one of the primary proposed avenues for improving algorithmic performance is the addition of molecular/biomarker/genetic features to the data used to train these systems, the overall sparsity of such available data suggests the need to generate synthetic data to aid in training, as has been the case in numerous other ML/AI tasks, such as image recognition/generation and text analysis/generation. We propose the need to generate synthetic molecular/mediator time series data coincides with the advent of the concept of medical digital twins, specifically related to interpretations of medical digital twins that hew closely to the original description and use of industrial digital twins, which involve simulating multiple individual twins from a common computational model specification. Herein we present an example of generating synthetic time series data of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines using the Critical Illness Digital Twin (CIDT) regarding the development of post-traumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n",

      "        Abstract: Recent global disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, have profoundly exposed vulnerabilities in traditional supply chains, requiring exploration of more resilient alternatives. Among various solution offerings, Autonomous supply chains (ASCs) have emerged as key enablers of increased integration and visibility, enhancing flexibility and resilience in turbulent trade environments through the widespread automation of low level decision making. Although ASC solutions have been discussed and trialled over several years, they still lack well-established theoretical foundations. This paper addresses this research gap by presenting a formal definition of ASC along with its defining characteristics and auxiliary concepts. We propose a layered conceptual framework, called the MIISI model. An illustrative case study focusing on the meat supply chain demonstrates an initial ASC implementation based on this conceptual model. Furthermore, we introduce a seven-level supply chain autonomy reference model, delineating a trajectory towards achieving full supply chain autonomy. Recognising that this work represents an initial endeavour, we emphasise the need for continued exploration in this emerging domain. This work is designed to stimulate further research, both theoretical and technical, and contribute to the continual evolution of ASCs.\n",

For AI community, the development of agents that react differently to different types of rewards can enable us to understand a wide spectrum of multi-agent interactions in complex real-world socioeconomic systems.

      "        Abstract: Increasingly, predicting and even controlling evolutionary processes is a sought after goal in fields ranging from agriculture, artificial intelligence, astrobiology, oncology, and infectious diseases. However, our ability to predict evolution and plan such interventions in real populations is limited in part by our understanding of how spatial structure modulates evolutionary dynamics. Among current clinical assays applied to predict drug response in infectious diseases, for instance, many do not explicitly consider spatial structure and its influence on phenotypic heterogeneity, despite it being an inextricable characteristic of real populations. As spatially structured populations are subject to increased interference of beneficial mutants compared to their well-mixed counter-parts, among other effects, this population heterogeneity and structure may non-trivially impact drug response. In spatially-structured populations, the extent of this mutant interference is density dependent and thus varies with relative position within a meta-population in a manner modulated by mutant frequency, selection strength, migration speed, and habitat length, among other factors. In this study, we examine beneficial mutant fixation dynamics along the front of an asexual population expanding its range. We observe that multiple distinct evolutionary regimes of beneficial mutant origin-fixation dynamics are maintained at characteristic length scales along the front of the population expansion. Using an agent-based simulation of range expansion with mutation and selection in one dimension, we measure these length scales across a range of population sizes, selection strengths, and mutation rates. Furthermore, using simple scaling arguments to adapt theory from well-mixed populations, we find that the length scale at the tip of the front within which ‘local’ mutant fixation occurs in a successive mode decreases with increasing mutation rate, as well as population size in a manner predicted by our derived analytic expression. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings to real cellular populations, arguing that this conserved region of successive mutant fixation dynamics at the wave tip can be exploited by emerging evolutionary control strategies.\n",

The advantage of this approach is that this library respects any coupling between systems components, whereas the SINDy algorithm (introduced by Brunton, Proctor and Kutz) treats the individual components as decoupled from one another. Another advantage of our approach is that we can use a non-negative least squares algorithm to find the non-negative rate constants in a very robust, stable and simple manner.

      "        Title: Not cheating on the Turing Test: towards grounded language learning in Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "        Abstract: In this thesis, I carry out a novel and interdisciplinary analysis into various complex factors involved in human natural-language acquisition, use and comprehension, aimed at uncovering some of the basic requirements for if we were to try and develop artificially intelligent (AI) agents with similar capacities. Inspired by a recent publication wherein I explored the complexities and challenges involved in enabling AI systems to deal with the grammatical (i.e. syntactic and morphological) irregularities and ambiguities inherent in natural language (Alberts, 2019), I turn my focus here towards appropriately inferring the content of symbols themselves-as 'grounded' in real-world percepts, actions, and situations. I first introduce the key theoretical problems I aim to address in theories of mind and language. For background, I discuss the co-development of AI and the controverted strands of computational theories of mind in cognitive science, and the grounding problem (or 'internalist trap') faced by them. I then describe the approach I take to address the grounding problem in the rest of the thesis. This proceeds in chapter I. To unpack and address the issue, I offer a critical analysis of the relevant theoretical literature in philosophy of mind, psychology, cognitive science and (cognitive) linguistics in chapter II. I first evaluate the major philosophical/psychological debates regarding the nature of concepts; theories regarding how concepts are acquired, used, and represented in the mind; and, on that basis, offer my own account of conceptual structure, grounded in current (cognitively plausible) connectionist theories of thought. To further explicate how such concepts are acquired and communicated, I evaluate the relevant embodied (e.g. cognitive, perceptive, sensorimotor, affective, etc.) factors involved in grounded human (social) cognition, drawing from current scientific research in the areas of 4E Cognition and social cognition. On that basis, I turn my focus specifically towards grounded theories of language, drawing from the cognitive linguistics programme that aims to develop a naturalised, cognitively plausible understanding of human concept/language acquisition and use. I conclude the chapter with a summary wherein I integrate my findings from these various disciplines, presenting a general theoretical basis upon which to evaluate more practical considerations for its implementation in AI-the topic of the following chapter. In chapter III, I offer an overview of the different major approaches (and their integrations) in the area of Natural Language Understanding in AI, evaluating their respective strengths and shortcomings in terms of specific models. I then offer a critical summary wherein I contrast and contextualise the different approaches in terms of the more fundamental theoretical convictions they seem to reflect. On that basis, in the final chapter, I re-evaluate the aforementioned grounding problem and the different ways in which it has been interpreted in different (theoretical and practical) disciplines, distinguishing between a stronger and weaker reading. I then present arguments for why implementing the stronger version in AI seems, both practically and theoretically, problematic. Instead, drawing from the theoretical insights I gathered, I consider some of the key requirements for 'grounding' (in the weaker sense) as much as possible of natural language use with robotic AI agents, including implementational constraints that might need to be put in place to achieve this. Finally, I evaluate some of the key challenges that may be involved, if indeed the aim were to meet all the requirements specified.\n",

To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases.
