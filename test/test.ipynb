      "        Abstract: With recent advances in multi-modal foundation models, the previously text-only large language models (LLM) have evolved to incorporate visual input, opening up unprecedented opportunities for various applications in visualization. Our work explores the utilization of the visual perception ability of multi-modal LLMs to develop Autonomous Visualization Agents (AVAs) that can interpret and accomplish user-defined visualization objectives through natural language. We propose the first framework for the design of AVAs and present several usage scenarios intended to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed paradigm. The addition of visual perception allows AVAs to act as the virtual visualization assistant for domain experts who may lack the knowledge or expertise in fine-tuning visualization outputs. Our preliminary exploration and proof-of-concept agents suggest that this approach can be widely applicable whenever the choices of appropriate visualization parameters require the interpretation of previous visual output. Feedback from unstructured interviews with experts in AI research, medical visualization, and radiology has been incorporated, highlighting the practicality and potential of AVAs. Our study indicates that AVAs represent a general paradigm for designing intelligent visualization systems that can achieve high-level visualization goals, which pave the way for developing expert-level visualization agents in the future.\n",

      "        Abstract: In scenarios with numerous emergencies that arise and require the assistance of various rescue units (e.g., medical, fire, & police forces), the rescue units would ideally be allocated quickly and distributedly while aiming to minimize casualties. This is one of many examples of distributed settings with service providers (the rescue units) and service requesters (the emergencies) which we term service oriented settings. Allocating the service providers in a distributed manner while aiming for a global optimum is hard to model, let alone achieve, using the existing Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) framework. Hence, the need for a novel approach and corresponding algorithms. We present the Service Oriented Multi-Agent Optimization Problem (SOMAOP), a new framework that overcomes the shortcomings of DCOP in service oriented settings. We evaluate the framework using various algorithms based on auctions and matching algorithms (e.g., Gale Shapely). We empirically show that algorithms based on repeated auctions converge to a high quality solution very fast, while repeated matching problems converge slower, but produce higher quality solutions. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over standard incomplete DCOP algorithms and a greedy centralized algorithm.\n",

      "        Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cancer is currently one of the leading causes of premature death in the world, and is predicted to continue rising even despite the continuous discovery of novel treatments. New approaches, like adaptive therapy, try to minimize the problem of drug resistance, but there are still many open questions and unstudied phenomena that need to be tackled in order to make this approaches viable in real patients; among these, the possible effects that restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations could have. RESULTS: We have developed a spatially explicit agent-based model capable of simulating tumor growth and adaptive therapy in a highly flexible way. We show that when we consider restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations and their effect in tumor architecture, the predicted genotypes of the cells that are inhibiting the growth of resistant cells can be very different to the ones predicted by perfectly mixed models. CONCLUSION: We identify a divergence between the expected and real genotypes of the cells inhibiting the growth of the resistant population that has not been previously documented. This effect, if not taken into account, could negatively affect our predictions of adaptive therapy success and could hinder our advances in the development of new approaches to improve adaptive therapy. This discovery suggests the need for more studies that take into account the spatial component of cancer, specially when dealing with tumors with high heterogeneity. Furthermore, our model is able to simulate scenarios of tumor development and adaptive therapy, making it useful both for research and for education.\n",

      "        Abstract: As we grant artificial intelligence increasing power and independence in contexts like healthcare, policing, and driving, AI faces moral dilemmas but lacks the tools to solve them. Warnings from regulators, philosophers, and computer scientists about the dangers of unethical artificial intelligence have spurred interest in automated ethics-i.e., the development of machines that can perform ethical reasoning. However, prior work in automated ethics rarely engages with philosophical literature. Philosophers have spent centuries debating moral dilemmas so automated ethics will be most nuanced, consistent, and reliable when it draws on philosophical literature. In this paper, I present an implementation of automated Kantian ethics that is faithful to the Kantian philosophical tradition. I formalize Kant's categorical imperative in Dyadic Deontic Logic, implement this formalization in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, and develop a testing framework to evaluate how well my implementation coheres with expected properties of Kantian ethic. My system is an early step towards philosophically mature ethical AI agents and it can make nuanced judgements in complex ethical dilemmas because it is grounded in philosophical literature. Because I use an interactive theorem prover, my system's judgements are explainable.\n",

      "        Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.\n",

      "        Title: Behavioral analytics for myopic agents\n",
      "        Abstract: Many multi-agent systems have the structure of a single coordinator providing behavioral or financial incentives to a large number of agents. In such settings, two challenges faced by the coordinator are a finite budget from which to allocate incentives, and an initial lack of knowledge about the utility function of the agents. Here, we present a behavioral analytics approach to solve the coordinator's problem when the agents make decisions by maximizing utility functions that depend on prior system states, inputs, and other parameters that are initially unknown and subject to partially unknown temporal dynamics. Our behavioral analytics framework involves three steps: first, we develop a behavioral model that describes the decision-making process of an agent; second, we use data to estimate behavioral model parameters for each agent and then use these estimates to predict future decisions of each agent; and third, we use the estimated behavioral model parameters to optimize a set of costly incentives to provide to each agent. In this paper, we describe a specific set of tools, models, and approaches that fit into this framework, and that adapt models and incentives as new information is collected by repeating the second and third steps of this framework. Furthermore, we prove that the incentives computed by this adaptive approach are asymptotically optimal with respect to a given loss function that describes the coordinator's objective. We optimize incentives utilizing a decomposition scheme, where each sub-problem solves the coordinator's problem for a single agent, and the master problem is a pure integer program. We conclude with a simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our behavioral analytics approach in designing personalized treatment plans for a weight loss program. The results show that our approach maintains efficacy of the program while reducing its costs by up to 60%, while adaptive heuristics provide substantially less savings.\n",

      "        Abstract: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the vector of a number of medically-important viruses, including dengue virus, yellow virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus, and as such vector control is a key approach to managing the diseases they cause. Understanding the impact of vector control on these diseases is aided by first understanding its impact on Ae. aegypti population dynamics. A number of detail-rich models have been developed to couple the dynamics of the immature and adult stages of Ae. aegypti. The numerous assumptions of these models enable them to realistically characterize impacts of mosquito control, but they also constrain the ability of such models to reproduce empirical patterns that do not conform to the models’ behavior. In contrast, statistical models afford sufficient flexibility to extract nuanced signals from noisy data, yet they have limited ability to make predictions about impacts of mosquito control on disease caused by pathogens that the mosquitoes transmit without extensive data on mosquitoes and disease. Here, we demonstrate how the differing strengths of mechanistic realism and statistical flexibility can be fused into a single model. Our analysis utilizes data from 176,352 household-level Ae. aegypti aspirator collections conducted during 1999-2011 in Iquitos, Peru. The key step in our approach is to calibrate a single parameter of the model to spatio-temporal abundance patterns predicted by a generalized additive model (GAM). In effect, this calibrated parameter absorbs residual variation in the abundance time-series not captured by other features of the mechanistic model. We then used this calibrated parameter and the literature-derived parameters in the agent-based model to explore Ae. aegypti population dynamics and the impact of insecticide spraying to kill adult mosquitoes. The baseline abundance predicted by the agent-based model closely matched that predicted by the GAM. Following spraying, the agent-based model predicted that mosquito abundance rebounds within about two months, commensurate with recent experimental data from Iquitos. Our approach was able to accurately reproduce abundance patterns in Iquitos and produce a realistic response to adulticide spraying, while retaining sufficient flexibility to be applied across a range of settings.\n",

      "        Abstract: Computational models help decision makers understand epidemic dynamics to optimize public health interventions. Agent-based simulation of disease spread in synthetic populations allows us to compare and contrast different effects across identical populations or to investigate the effect of interventions keeping every other factor constant between \"digital twins\". In particular, we can observe the behavior of two different diseases as they evolve from identical initial conditions in the same population. FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) is an agent-based modeling system with a geospatial perspective using a synthetic population that is constructed based on the U.S. census data. Having synthetic data provides a baseline to get comparable results from different conditions and interventions. In this paper we show how Gaussian process regression can be used on FRED-synthesized data to infer the differing spatial dispersion of the epidemic dynamics for two disease conditions that start from the same initial conditions and spread among identical populations. Our results showcase the utility of agent-based simulations frameworks such as FRED for inferring differences between conditions where controlling for all confounding factors for such comparisons is next to impossible without synthetic data. We also show the advantage of surrogate models such as Gaussian process regression when the computational cost of inference with synthetic data alone is foreboding.\n",
