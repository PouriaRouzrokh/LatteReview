This dataset was created using a quick and simple PubMed search, and we do not claim that it is comprehensive. The intention of this notebook is not to conduct a thorough investigation of this topic or to advocate against COVID-19 vaccines. On the contrary, we believe that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective and have saved millions of lives. Our purpose here is to demonstrate the use of the LatteReview package with a topic that may interest many people."

    "Now, we will begin by defining three agents to conduct the literature review. The first two agents will act as scoring reviewers, tasked with examining each abstract to determine if it introduces any complications related to COVID-19 vaccines. For simplicity, if both reviewers agree on this initial step, the corresponding article will be shortlisted for the next stage. In the second step, we will define a third agent, referred to as the extraction reviewer, which will extract the names of the complications mentioned in the abstracts concerning COVID-19 vaccines. We will establish a workflow where the first two agents perform the initial round of review, and subsequently, the third agent will identify and extract the complications from the abstracts successfully selected in the first round."

    "By examining the above list of complications, it is evident that some complications have different labels but refer to similar pathologies. Although we can proceed with the current list, it may be beneficial to standardize it so that complications referring to the same pathology are labeled consistently. One strategy for achieving this is to make a single call to a large language model to replace each pathology name with its corresponding PubMed MeSH term. GPT-4-O, in particular, has a strong understanding of MeSH terms and can efficiently standardize the extracted complications by replacing them with their appropriate MeSH terms. Note that, as this is a single call to GPT-4-O (not a call per article or per list), we will not involve any reviewer for this task. Instead, we will simply call the OpenAI provider once to standardize all the complications identified so far."
