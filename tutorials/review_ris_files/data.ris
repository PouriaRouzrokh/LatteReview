AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pediatric elbow fractures are a common injury among children.
      Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep
      learning (DL), have shown promise in diagnosing these fractures. This
      study systematically evaluated the performance of DL models in detecting
      pediatric elbow fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search
      was conducted in PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and IEEE Xplore for studies
      published up to October 20, 2023. Studies employing DL models for
      detecting elbow fractures in patients aged 0 to 16 years were included.
      Key performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and area
      under the curve (AUC), were extracted. The study was registered in
      PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023470558). RESULTS: The search identified 22 studies,
      of which six met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The pooled
      sensitivity of DL models for pediatric elbow fracture detection was 0.93
      (95% CI: 0.91-0.96). Specificity values ranged from 0.84 to 0.92 across
      studies, with a pooled estimate of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.92). The AUC
      ranged from 0.91 to 0.99, with a pooled estimate of 0.95 (95% CI:
      0.93-0.97). Further analysis highlighted the impact of preprocessing
      techniques and the choice of model backbone architecture on performance.
      CONCLUSION: DL models demonstrate exceptional accuracy in detecting
      pediatric elbow fractures. For optimal performance, we recommend
      leveraging backbone architectures like ResNet, combined with manual
      preprocessing supervised by radiology and orthopedic experts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising approach to
      balancing high image quality with reduced radiation exposure in computed
      tomography (CT) imaging. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis evaluates the
      effectiveness of AI in enhancing CT image quality and lowering radiation
      doses. METHODS: A thorough literature search was performed across several
      databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Science Direct, and
      Cochrane Library, with the final update in 2024. We included studies that
      compared AI-based interventions to conventional CT techniques. The quality
      of these studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random
      effect models were used to pool results, and heterogeneity was measured
      using the IÂ² statistic. Primary outcomes included image quality, CT dose
      index, and diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: This meta-analysis incorporated 5
      clinical validation studies published between 2022 and 2024, totaling 929
      participants. Results indicated that AI-based interventions significantly
      improved image quality (mean difference 0.70, 95% CI 0.43-0.96; P<.001)
      and showed a positive trend in reducing the CT dose index, though not
      statistically significant (mean difference 0.47, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.15;
      P=.18). AI also enhanced image analysis efficiency (odds ratio 1.57, 95%
      CI 1.08-2.27; P=.02) and demonstrated high accuracy and sensitivity in
      detecting intracranial aneurysms, with low-dose CT using AI reconstruction
      showing noninferiority for liver lesion detection. CONCLUSIONS: The
      findings suggest that AI-based interventions can significantly enhance CT
      imaging practices by improving image quality and potentially reducing
      radiation doses, which may lead to better diagnostic accuracy and patient
      safety. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to
      the limited number of studies and the variability in AI algorithms.
      Further research is needed to clarify AI's impact on radiation reduction
      and to establish clinical standards.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With advancements in medical technology and science, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the world's three major
      chronic diseases, has seen numerous remarkable outcomes when combined with
      artificial intelligence, particularly in disease diagnosis. However, the
      diagnostic performance of these AI models still lacks comprehensive
      evidence. Therefore, this study quantitatively analyzed the diagnostic
      performance of AI models in CT images of COPD patients, aiming to promote
      the development of related research in the future. METHODS: PubMed,
      Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase were retrieved up to
      September 1, 2024. The QUADAS-2 evaluation tool was used to assess the
      quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis of the included researches
      was performed using Stata18, RevMan 5.4, and Meta-Disc 1.4 software to
      merge sensitivity, specificity and plot a summary receiver operating
      characteristic curve (SROC). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q
      statistic, and sources of inter-study heterogeneity were explored through
      meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two of 3280 identified studies
      were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed on 15 of these studies,
      encompassing a total of 22,817 patients for which statistical metrics were
      reported or could be calculated. Seven studies were based on deep learning
      (DL) model, three on machine learning (ML) model, and five on DL model
      with multiple-instance learning (MIL) mechanisms. One study evaluated both
      DL and ML models. The meta-analysis results showed that the pooled
      sensitivity of all DL and ML models was 86 % (95 %CI 78-91 %), specificity
      was 87 % (95 %CI 83-91 %), and area under the curve was 93 % (95 %CI 90-95
      %). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant difference in diagnostic
      sensitivity and specificity between DL and ML models (sensitivity 82 % (95
      %CI 76-87 %), 93 % (95 %CI 85-97 %); specificity 87 % (95 %CI 79-91 %), 84
      % (95 %CI 79-88 %), and the DL model with MIL (sensitivity 87 % (95 %CI
      61-96 %); specificity 89 % (95 %CI 78-95 %) improved the performance of DL
      model, but this improvement was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Both DL and ML models for diagnosing COPD using CT images
      exhibited high accuracy. There was no significant difference in diagnostic
      efficacy between the two types of AI models, and the addition of the MIL
      mechanism may enhance the performance of the DL model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including machine
      learning and deep learning, are increasingly applied in orthodontics for
      tasks like assessing skeletal maturity. Accurate timing of treatment is
      crucial, but traditional methods such as cervical vertebral maturation
      (CVM) staging have limitations due to observer variability and complexity.
      AI has the potential to automate CVM assessment, enhancing reliability and
      user-friendliness. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to
      evaluate the overall performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models in
      assessing cervical vertebrae maturation (CVM) in radiographs, when
      compared to clinicians. METHODS: Electronic databases of Medline (via
      PubMed), Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, IEEE ArXiv and MedRxiv were
      searched for publications after 2010, without any limitation on language.
      In the present review, we included studies that reported AI models'
      performance on CVM assessment. Quality assessment was done using Quality
      assessment and diagnostic accuracy Tool-2 (QUADAS-2). Quantitative
      analysis was conducted using hierarchical logistic regression for
      meta-analysis on diagnostic accuracy. Subgroup analysis was conducted on
      different AI subsets (Deep learning, and Machine learning). RESULTS: A
      total of 1606 studies were screened of which 25 studies were included. The
      performance of the models was acceptable. However, it varied based on the
      methods employed. Eight studies had a low risk of bias in all domains.
      Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis and their pooled values
      for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and
      diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated for each cervical stage (CS).
      The most accurate CVM evaluation was observed for CS1, boasting a
      sensitivity of 0.87, a specificity of 0.97, and a DOR of 213. Conversely,
      CS3 exhibited the lowest performance with a sensitivity of 0.64, and a
      specificity of 0.96, yet maintaining a DOR of 32. CONCLUSION: AI has
      demonstrated encouraging outcomes in CVM assessment, achieving notable
      accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms, machine
      learning methodologies and associated accuracies used in detecting dental
      caries from clinical images and dental radiographs. METHODS: A systematic
      search of 8 distinct electronic databases: Scopus, Web of Science,
      MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Centre, Institute of Electrical
      and Electronics Engineers Explore, Science Direct, Directory of Open
      Access Journals and JSTOR, was conducted from January 2000 to March 2024.
      AI platforms, machine learning methodologies and associated accuracies of
      studies using AI for dental caries detection were extracted along with
      essential study characteristics. The quality of included studies was
      assessed using QUADAS-2 and the CLAIM checklist. Meta-analysis was
      performed to obtain a quantitative estimate of AI accuracy. RESULTS: Of
      the 2538 studies identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria and underwent
      qualitative synthesis. Of the 45 included studies, 33 used dental
      radiographs, and 12 used clinical images as datasets. A total of 21
      different AI platforms were reported. The accuracy ranged from 41.5% to
      98.6% across reported AI platforms. A quantitative meta-analysis across 7
      studies reported a mean sensitivity of 76% [95% CI (65% - 85%)] and
      specificity of 91% [(95% CI (86% - 95%)]. The area under the curve (AUC)
      was 92% [95% CI (89% - 94%)], with high heterogeneity across included
      studies. CONCLUSION: Significant variability exists in AI performance for
      detecting dental caries across different AI platforms. Meta-analysis
      demonstrates that AI has superior sensitivity and equal specificity of
      detecting dental caries from clinical images as compared to bitewing
      radiography. Although AI is promising for dental caries detection, further
      refinement is necessary to achieve consistent and reliable performance
      across varying imaging modalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone metastases (BM) represent a prevalent complication of
      tumors. Early and accurate diagnosis, however, is a significant hurdle for
      radiologists. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a
      valuable tool to assist radiologists in the detection of BM. This
      meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate the AI diagnostic accuracy for
      BM. METHODS: Two reviewers performed an exhaustive search of several
      databases, including Wei Pu (VIP) database, China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid-Embase,
      Ovid-Medline, Wan Fang database, and China Biology Medicine (CBM), from
      their inception to December 2024. This search focused on studies that
      developed and/or validated AI techniques for detecting BM in magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). A hierarchical model
      was used in the meta-analysis to calculate diagnostic odds ratio (DOR),
      negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), area
      under the curve (AUC), specificity (SP), and pooled sensitivity (SE). The
      risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the Prediction Model
      Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), while the Transparent Reporting of
      a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or
      diagnosis-artificial intelligence (TRIPOD-AI) was employed for evaluating
      the quality of evidence. RESULT: This review covered 20 articles, among
      them, 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed
      a pooled SE of 0.88 (0.82-0.92), a pooled SP of 0.89 (0.84-0.93), a pooled
      AUC of 0.95 (0.92-0.96), PLR of 8.1 (5.57-11.80), NLR of 0.14 (0.09-0.21)
      and DOR of 58 (31-109). When focusing on imaging algorithms. Based on ML,
      a pooled SE of 0.88 (0.77-0.92), SP 0.88 (0.82-0.92), and AUC 0.93
      (0.91-0.95). Based on DL, a pooled SE of 0.89 (0.81-0.95), SP 0.89
      (0.81-0.94), and AUC 0.95 (0.93-0.97). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis
      underscores the substantial diagnostic value of AI in identifying BM.
      Nevertheless, in-depth large-scale prospective research should be carried
      out for confirming AI's clinical utility in BM management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression has been linked to disruptions in resting-state
      networks (RSNs). However, inconsistent findings on RSN disruptions, with
      variations in reported connectivity within and between RSNs, complicate
      the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression.
      METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed and Web of Science
      identified studies that employed resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore RSN changes in depression. Studies
      using seed-based functional connectivity analysis or independent component
      analysis were included, and coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed
      to evaluate alterations in RSN connectivity both within and between
      networks. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies were included, comprising 2321
      patients with depression and 2197 healthy controls. The meta-analysis
      revealed significant alterations in RSN connectivity, both within and
      between networks, in patients with depression compared with healthy
      controls. Specifically, within-network changes included both increased and
      decreased connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) and increased
      connectivity in the frontoparietal network (FPN). Between-network findings
      showed increased DMN-FPN and limbic network (LN)-DMN connectivity,
      decreased DMN-somatomotor network and LN-FPN connectivity, and varied
      ventral attention network (VAN)-dorsal attentional network (DAN)
      connectivity. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between
      illness duration and increased connectivity between the VAN and DAN.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings not only provide a comprehensive
      characterization of RSN disruptions in depression but also enhance our
      understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression.

AB  - Purpose: To conduct a systematic review of artificial intelligence (AI) in
      aiding clinicians with the prediction and detection specifically for early
      childhood caries (ECC). Methods: A search was performed across PubMedÂ®,
      EMBASEÂ®, Scopus, Web of ScienceTM, IEEE, and grey literature (Google
      Scholar) databases. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
      Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was utilized to evaluate the potential bias.
      Statistical analyses were performed using random effects models in STATA
      17.0, with Metandi and MIDAS packages. Results: Of 350 identified studies,
      21 met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies demonstrated a low risk of
      bias in all QUADAS-2 categories. Studies were divided into two cate-
      gories: detection of ECC (7 studies) and prediction of ECC (14 studies).
      For ECC detection, studies reported accuracy between 78 to 86 percent,
      sen- sitivity ranged from 67 to 96 percent, and specificity ranged from 81
      to 99 percent. In prediction-focused research, accuracies varied widely
      from 60 to 100 percent, sensitivity from 20 to 100 percent, and
      specificity from 54 to 94 percent. Six studies with adequate data were
      selected for the meta-analysis. The combined sensitivity of these studies
      was calculated at 80 percent (95 percent confidence interval [95% CI]
      equals 0.84 to 0.95), while the combined specificity reached 81 percent
      (95% CI equals 0.67 to 0.90). The diagnostic odds ratios ranged from 4 to
      83, with a median of 17. Conclusion: AIs diagnostic accuracy for early
      childhood caries matches that of experienced dentists, emphasizing AI's
      potential to significantly aid in the detection and prediction of ECC.

TI  - Deep learning-based evaluation of panoramic radiographs for osteoporosis
      screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a complex condition that drives research into
      its causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, significantly affecting
      patients and healthcare providers in various aspects of life. Research is
      exploring orthopantomogram (OPG) radiography for osteoporosis screening
      instead of bone mineral density (BMD) assessments. Although this method
      uses various indicators, manual analysis can be challenging. Machine
      learning and deep learning techniques have been developed to address this.
      This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to evaluate the
      accuracy of deep learning models in predicting osteoporosis from OPG
      radiographs, providing evidence for their performance and clinical use.
      METHODS: A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of
      Science up to February 10, 2025, using the keywords related to deep
      learning, osteoporosis, and panoramic radiography. We conducted title,
      abstract, and full-text screening based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model to pool
      diagnostic accuracy measures, and subgroup analyses explored sources of
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found 204 articles, removed 189 duplicates and
      irrelevant studies, assessed 15articles, and ultimately, seven studies
      were selected. The DL models showed AUC values of 66.8-99.8%, with
      sensitivity and specificity ranging from 59 to 97% and 64.9-100%,
      respectively. No significant differences in diagnostic accuracy were found
      among subgroups. AlexNet had the highest performance, achieving a
      sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.99. Sensitivity analysis
      revealed that excluding outliers had little impact on the results. Deeks'
      funnel plot indicated no significant publication bias (P = 0.54).
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that deep learning models
      for osteoporosis diagnosis achieved 80% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and
      93% AUC. Models like AlexNet and ResNet demonstrate effectiveness. These
      findings suggest that DL models are promising for noninvasive early
      detection, but more extensive multicenter studies are necessary to
      validate their efficacy in at-risk groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive condition
      characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Vision transformers
      (ViTs) are emerging as promising deep learning models in medical imaging,
      with potential applications in the detection and diagnosis of AD.
      OBJECTIVE: This review systematically examines recent studies on the
      application of ViTs in detecting AD, evaluating the diagnostic accuracy
      and impact of network architecture on model performance. METHODS: We
      conducted a systematic search across major medical databases, including
      China National Knowledge Infrastructure, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials), ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, and
      Scopus, covering publications from January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2024. A
      manual search was also performed to include relevant gray literature. The
      included papers used ViT models for AD detection versus healthy controls
      based on neuroimaging data, and the included studies used magnetic
      resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Pooled diagnostic
      accuracy estimates, including sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios,
      and diagnostic odds ratios, were derived using random-effects models.
      Subgroup analyses comparing the diagnostic performance of different ViT
      network architectures were performed. RESULTS: The meta-analysis,
      encompassing 11 studies with 95% CIs and P values, demonstrated pooled
      diagnostic accuracy: sensitivity 0.925 (95% CI 0.892-0.959; P<.01),
      specificity 0.957 (95% CI 0.932-0.981; P<.01), positive likelihood ratio
      21.84 (95% CI 12.26-38.91; P<.01), and negative likelihood ratio 0.08 (95%
      CI 0.05-0.14; P<.01). The area under the curve was notably high at 0.924.
      The findings highlight the potential of ViTs as effective tools for early
      and accurate AD diagnosis, offering insights for future neuroimaging-based
      diagnostic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides
      valuable evidence for the utility of ViT models in distinguishing patients
      with AD from healthy controls, thereby contributing to advancements in
      neuroimaging-based diagnostic methodologies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO
