      "Title: Integration of convolutional neural networks for pulmonary nodule malignancy assessment in a lung cancer classification pipeline\n",
      "Abstract: The early identification of malignant pulmonary nodules is critical for a better lung cancer prognosis and less invasive chemo or radio therapies. Nodule malignancy assessment done by radiologists is extremely useful for planning a preventive intervention but is, unfortunately, a complex, time-consuming and error-prone task. This explains the lack of large datasets containing radiologists malignancy characterization of nodules; METHODS: In this article, we propose to assess nodule malignancy through 3D convolutional neural networks and to integrate it in an automated end-to-end existing pipeline of lung cancer detection. For training and testing purposes we used independent subsets of the LIDC dataset; RESULTS: Adding the probabilities of nodules malignity in a baseline lung cancer pipeline improved its F1-weighted score by 14.7%, whereas integrating the malignancy model itself using transfer learning outperformed the baseline prediction by 11.8% of F1-weighted score; CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited size of the lung cancer datasets, integrating predictive models of nodule malignancy improves prediction of lung cancer.\n",

      "Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic and is placing additional burden on healthcare systems around the world. Timely and effectively detecting the virus can help to reduce the spread of the disease. Although, RT-PCR is still a gold standard for COVID-19 testing, deep learning models to identify the virus from medical images can also be helpful in certain circumstances. In particular, in situations when patients undergo routine X-rays and/or CT-scans tests but within a few days of such tests they develop respiratory complications. Deep learning models can also be used for pre-screening prior to RT-PCR testing. However, the transparency/interpretability of the reasoning process of predictions made by such deep learning models is essential. In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model that uses positive reasoning process to make predictions. We trained and tested our model over the dataset of chest CT-scan images of COVID-19 patients, normal people and pneumonia patients. Our model gives the accuracy, precision, recall and F-score equal to 99.48%, 0.99, 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\n",
