## 🎯 Key Features

- Multi-agent review system with customizable roles and expertise levels for each reviewer
- Support for multiple review rounds with hierarchical decision-making workflows
- Review diverse content types including article titles, abstracts, custom texts, and even **images** using LLM-powered reviewer agents
- Define reviewer agents with specialized backgrounds and distinct evaluation capabilities (e.g., scoring or concept abstraction or custom reviewers of your own preferance)
- Create flexible review workflows where multiple agents operate in parallel or sequential arrangements
- Enable reviewer agents to analyze peer feedback, cast votes, and propose corrections to other reviewers' assessments
- Enhance reviews with item-specific context integration, supporting use cases like **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Broad compatibility with LLM providers through LiteLLM, including OpenAI and Ollama
- Model-agnostic integration supporting OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Groq, and local models via Ollama
- High-performance asynchronous processing for efficient batch reviews
- Standardized output format featuring detailed scoring metrics and reasoning transparency
- Robust cost tracking and memory management systems
- Extensible architecture supporting custom review workflow implementation

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install lattereview
```

Please refer to our [installation guide](./docs/installation.md) for detailed instructions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

LatteReview enables you to create custom literature review workflows with multiple AI reviewers. Each reviewer can use different models and providers based on your needs. Below is a working example of how you can use LatteReview for doing a quick title/abstract review with two junior and one senior reviewers (all AI agents)!

Please refer to our [Quick Start](./docs/quickstart.md) page for detailed instructions.

```python
from lattereview.providers import LiteLLMProvider
from lattereview.agents import ScoringReviewer
from lattereview.workflows import ReviewWorkflow
import pandas as pd
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from the .env file in the root directory of your project
load_dotenv()

# First Reviewer: Conservative approach
reviewer1 = ScoringReviewer(
    provider=LiteLLMProvider(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    name="Alice",
    backstory="a radiologist with expertise in systematic reviews",
    scoring_task="Evaluate how relevant the article is to artificial intelligence applications in radiology",
    scoring_set=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    scoring_rules="Rate the relevance on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means not relevant to AI in radiology, and 5 means directly focused on AI in radiology",
    model_args={"temperature": 0.1}
)

# Second Reviewer: More exploratory approach
reviewer2 = ScoringReviewer(
    provider=LiteLLMProvider(model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash"),
    name="Bob",
    backstory="a computer scientist specializing in medical AI",
    scoring_task="Evaluate how relevant the article is to artificial intelligence applications in radiology",
    scoring_set=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    scoring_rules="Rate the relevance on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means not relevant to AI in radiology, and 5 means directly focused on AI in radiology",
    model_args={"temperature": 0.8}
)

# Expert Reviewer: Resolves disagreements
expert = ScoringReviewer(
    provider=LiteLLMProvider(model="gpt-4o"),
    name="Carol",
    backstory="a professor of AI in medical imaging",
    scoring_task="Review Alice and Bob's relevance assessments of this article to AI in radiology",
    scoring_set=[1, 2],
    scoring_rules='Score 1 if you agree with Alice\'s assessment, 2 if you agree with Bob\'s assessment',
    model_args={"temperature": 0.1}
)

# Define workflow
workflow = ReviewWorkflow(
    workflow_schema=[
        {
            "round": 'A',  # First round: Initial review by both reviewers
            "reviewers": [reviewer1, reviewer2],
            "text_inputs": ["title", "abstract"]
        },
        {
            "round": 'B',  # Second round: Expert reviews only disagreements
            "reviewers": [expert],
            "text_inputs": ["title", "abstract", "round-A_Alice_output", "round-A_Bob_output"],
            "filter": lambda row: row["round-A_Alice_score"] != row["round-A_Bob_score"]
        }
    ]
)

# Load and process your data
data = pd.read_excel("articles.xlsx")  # Must have 'title' and 'abstract' columns
results = asyncio.run(workflow(data))  # Returns a pandas DataFrame with all original and output columns

# Save results
results.to_csv("review_results.csv", index=False)
```

## 🔌 Model Support

LatteReview offers flexible model integration through multiple providers:

- **LiteLLMProvider** (Recommended): Supports OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Gemini, Groq, and more
- **OpenAIProvider**: Direct integration with OpenAI and Gemini APIs
- **OllamaProvider**: Optimized for local models via Ollama

Note: Models should support async operations and structured JSON outputs for optimal performance.

## 🛣️ Roadmap for Future Features

- [x] Implementing LiteLLM to add support for additional model providers
- [x] Draft the package full documentation
- [x] Enable agents to return a percentage of certainty
- [x] Enable agents to be grounded in static references (text provided by the user)
- [x] Enable agents to be grounded in dynamic references (i.e., recieve a function that outputs a text based on the input text. This function could, e.g., be a RAG function.)
- [x] Support for image-based inputs and multimodal analysis
- [x] Development of `AbstractionReviewer` class for automated paper summarization
- [x] Showcase how `AbstractionReviewer` class could be used to analyse the literature around a certain topic.
- [x] Adding a tutorial example and also a section to the docs on how to create custom reviewer agents.
- [ ] Writing the white paper for the package and public launch
- [ ] Development of a no-code web application
- [ ] (for v>2.0.0) Adding conformal prediction tool for calibrating agents on their certainty scores
- [ ] (for v>2.0.0) Adding a dialogue tool for enabling agents to seek external help (from helper agents or parallel reviewer agents) during review.
- [ ] (for v>2.0.0) Adding a memory component to the agents for saving their own insights or insightful feedback they receive from the helper agents.
