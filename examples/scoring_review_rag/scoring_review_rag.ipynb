One day, as she perched atop the highest branch, she overheard a conversation in the wind between two ancient oak trees discussing the arrival of a mysterious traveler.

The traveler paused at the foot of Elara\\'s tree, glanced upward, and said, \"I seek the knowledge you have guarded for centuries.\" Elara blinked her large, golden eyes, recognizing this moment as one foretold by the stars long ago, and prepared to share the secrets she had kept under her wings.>> ${examples}$',\n",
