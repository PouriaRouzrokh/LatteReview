It was said that Eldergrove was as old as time itself, with branches stretching out like the fingers of an old, wise giant. The villagers from the nearby town often whispered about the magical fruit it bore once every hundred years. Young Dara, who was both curious and bold, decided to seek out this legendary tree. Guided by a map she found in a dusty old book at the library, she embarked on her journey. When Dara finally reached Eldergrove, she was in awe of its majesty. Hanging from one of the branches was a single, glowing fruit, pulsating with a soft golden light. As she reached out to touch it, she heard a faint whisper that seemed to come from the tree itself, \"Only those pure of heart may taste my fruit.\">>',\n",
