Use the following additional context for your scoring: <<In a small coastal village, nestled between the azure ocean and the emerald hills, lived an old fisherman named Elias. Elias had spent his entire life on the sea, his face weathered by the sun and salt, his hands coarse from years of hauling nets. One day, while fishing near the coral reefs, Elias spotted a glimmer beneath the waves. Diving down, he discovered a chest encrusted with barnacles. Inside, to his astonishment, was a collection of ancient coins, each etched with mysterious symbols. Elias decided to keep his discovery a secret, fearing that others might disturb the sea's tranquility in search of more treasure. As the years passed, he often wondered what stories those coins could tell, as he watched the sun set over the endless horizon.>>\",\n",
