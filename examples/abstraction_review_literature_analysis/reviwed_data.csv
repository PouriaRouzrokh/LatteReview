37789968,PMC10544010,Remimazolam vs Etomidate: Haemodynamic Effects in Hypertensive Elderly Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery.,Chen J||Zou X||Hu B||Yang Y||Wang F||Zhou Q||Shen M,"BACKGROUND: Remimazolam tosilate (RT) is a novel ultrashort-acting gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype A (GABA(A)) agonist, with several advantages including rapid induction and recovery, stable haemodynamics, and mild respiratory inhibition. However, studies have not been conducted to explore the haemodynamic effects of RT in elderly hypertensive subjects undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Therefore, we sought to compare the effects of anaesthesia induction using different doses of RT and etomidate on the haemodynamics of this group of patients. METHODS: Patients were recruited into this single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind trial from October 2022 to June 2023. A total of 150 hypertensive elderly undergoing non-cardiac surgery were randomly assigned into 0.2 mg/kg RT group (Group RL), 0.3 mg/kg RT group (Group RH) and 0.3 mg/kg etomidate group (Group E). The primary outcome of the study was haemodynamic changes (mean arterial pressure fluctuation value -∆MAP and heart rate fluctuation value -∆HR) observed during anaesthesia induction. Secondary outcomes included incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and adverse drug reactions (injection pain and myoclonus), cumulative doses of vasoactive drugs and vital signs at different time points. RESULTS: Patients in Group E and Group RL had significantly lower haemodynamic fluctuations (∆MAP), lower incidence of hypotension and cumulative dose of ephedrine than subjects in Group RH. Patients in groups RL and RH had significantly lower incidence of injection pain and myoclonus compared with patients in group E. The results showed no statistically significant differences in ∆HR, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, and time to loss of eye-opening reflex and start of intubation, and vital signs at different time points among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Use of low-dose RT (0.2 mg/kg) for induction of non-cardiac surgical anaesthesia in elderly hypertensive patients is more effective in maintaining haemodynamic stability and has fewer adverse effects compared with etomidate.",2023,20230927.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the haemodynamic effects of anaesthesia induction in elderly hypertensive patients, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the haemodynamic effects of anaesthesia induction in elderly hypertensive patients, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
34558599,PMC8500128,Early Post-Renal Transplant Hyperglycemia.,Iqbal A||Zhou K||Kashyap SR||Lansang MC,"CONTEXT: Though posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM, occurring > 45 days after transplantation) and its complications are well described, early post-renal transplant hyperglycemia (EPTH) (< 45 days) similarly puts kidney transplant recipients at risk of infections, rehospitalizations, and graft failure and is not emphasized much in the literature. Proactive screening and management of EPTH is required given these consequences. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to promote recognition of early post-renal transplant hyperglycemia, and to summarize available information on its pathophysiology, adverse effects, and management. METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted for ""early post-renal transplant hyperglycemia,"" ""immediate posttransplant hyperglycemia,"" ""post-renal transplant diabetes,"" ""renal transplant,"" ""diabetes,"" and combinations of these terms. EPTH is associated with significant complications including acute graft failure, rehospitalizations, cardiovascular events, PTDM, and infections. CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes experience better glycemic control in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with resurgence of hyperglycemia after kidney transplant. Patients with and without known diabetes are at risk of EPTH. Risk factors include elevated pretransplant fasting glucose, diabetes, glucocorticoids, chronic infections, and posttransplant infections. We find that EPTH increases risk of re-hospitalizations from infections (cytomegalovirus, possibly COVID-19), acute graft rejections, cardiovascular events, and PTDM. It is essential, therefore, to provide diabetes education to patients before discharge. Insulin remains the standard of care while inpatient. Close follow-up after discharge is recommended for insulin adjustment. Some agents like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have shown promise. The tenuous kidney function in the early posttransplant period and lack of data limit the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. There is a need for studies assessing noninsulin agents for EPTH to decrease risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and long-term complications of EPTH.",2022 Jan 18,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses early post-renal transplant hyperglycemia and its complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses early post-renal transplant hyperglycemia and its complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,
38716533,,Atorvastatin-induced Myositis and Drug-induced Liver Injury.,Kashyap K||Bisht K||Dhar M||Mittal K,"Statins are drugs for preventing cardiac events in the elderly population. Statins are well tolerated with a lower reported incidence of serious side effects (<0.15%) like myopathy and elevated transaminases [>3x upper limit of normal (ULN)]. Serious adverse effects of statins like statin-associated myopathy range from mild muscle pain to rhabdomyolysis. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is another adverse effect of statin use, typically presenting with an acute hepatocellular liver injury pattern as mixed or cholestatic injury. Symptoms usually disappear after 3 months of discontinuation of statins. Some patients require immunosuppression with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or rituximab for management of rhabdomyolysis. DILI can be rapidly reversed by the stoppage of the statins if the enzyme elevation is more than twice the normal. Elderly patients are particularly at increased risk of such adverse effects, emphasizing a need for rational prescription of statins in older adults and close monitoring. We report a case of an elderly presenting with paraparesis and later diagnosed to be a case of statin-induced myositis that significantly improved with prompt management.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the cardiac complications of COVID19 vaccines, based on vaccine type (mRNA, vector-based, and inactivated vaccines). METHODS: A systematic search was performed covering PubMed for English case-reports and case-series studies, and finally 100 studies were included. RESULTS: Myocarditis (with overall rate around 1.62%) was shown to be the most common post-COVID19 immunization cardiac event. More than 90% of post-COVID19 vaccination myocarditis occurred after receiving mRNA vaccines (Moderna & Pfizer-BioNTech), but the report of this event was less in the case of vector-based vaccinations and/or inactivated vaccines. Myocarditis was reported more commonly in men and following the second dose of the immunization. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) was reported after mRNA (more commonly) and vector-based vaccinations, with no case report after inactivated vaccines. When mRNA and vector-based vaccinations were used instead of inactivated vaccines, a greater frequency of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and pulmonary emboli (PE) was reported. Myocardial infarction/cardiac arrest was recorded in those beyond the age of 75 years. CONCLUSION: The personal and public health benefits of COVID-19 vaccination much outweigh the minor cardiac risks.

We, therefore, systematically evaluated cases of post-vaccinal serious neurological and psychiatric adverse reactions published from India. A systematic review of cases published from India, which were archived in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, was performed; pre-print databases along with ahead-of-print contents were searched in addition. Retrieved articles, as on June 27, 2022, were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. EndNote 20 web tool was used to make a PRISMA flow chart. Individual patients' data were compiled in a tabular form. The protocol of the systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022324183). A total of 64 records describing 136 instances of serious neurological and psychiatric adverse events were identified. More than 50% (36/64) reports were from the following four states, namely, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi, and West Bengal. The mean age of persons developing these complications was 44.89 +/- 15.77 years. In the majority, adverse events occurred within 2 weeks of administration of the first dose of COVISHIELD vaccine. Immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) disorders were identified in 54 instances. Guillain-Barre syndrome and other immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies were reported in 21 cases. Post-vaccinal herpes zoster was recorded in 31 vaccine recipients. Psychiatric adverse events were recorded in six patients. In Indian recipients of COVID-19 vaccine, a variety of serious neurological complications were reported. The overall risk appears minuscule.

One common immunosuppressant for MG, Tacrolimus, is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450. However, Paxlovid, an antiviral medication, inhibits cytochrome P450 activity, which can lead to increased Tacrolimus levels and potential toxicity when the two drugs are combined. In this case report, we present the case of a 39-year-old woman with early-onset MG who was initially treated with Tacrolimus. Later, she received Paxlovid for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which resulted in a sudden spike in Tacrolimus levels due to the drug interaction. This case emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment plans and close monitoring of drug interactions in patients with multiple health conditions. Clinicians should exercise vigilance regarding potential Tacrolimus interactions and regularly monitor blood levels to prevent adverse effects.

CASE-FINDING METHODS: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). RESULTS: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected </=3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving >/=4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). CONCLUSIONS: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host's response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million COVID-19-associated ATM cases found in this report. The pathogenesis of ATM remains unknown, but it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 antigens -perhaps also present in the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine or its chimpanzee adenovirus adjuvant- may induce immune mechanisms leading to the myelitis.",2021,20210426.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract explicitly mentions 3 cases of ATM reported as serious adverse events during clinical trials of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, directly addressing the criteria.', 'score': 1}","The abstract explicitly mentions 3 cases of ATM reported as serious adverse events during clinical trials of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, directly addressing the criteria.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications associated with COVID-19, specifically acute transverse myelitis (ATM), and includes a section on serious adverse events related to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, thus meeting the criteria for discussing vaccination complications.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications associated with COVID-19, specifically acute transverse myelitis (ATM), and includes a section on serious adverse events related to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, thus meeting the criteria for discussing vaccination complications.",1,90,"{'complications': ['acute transverse myelitis (ATM)', 'acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)', 'blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO)', 'acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)']}","['acute transverse myelitis (ATM)', 'acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)', 'blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO)', 'acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)']"

Lipegfilgrastim is a long-acting G-CSF. Albeit it provides ease of administration compared to short-acting GCSFs, some lipegfilgrastim-related adverse events may occur. Bone pain, widespread body pain, and feeling of fever are among common adverse effects, while rare but more serious adverse effects such as leukocytosis, spleen rupture, interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, capillary leak syndrome, hypokalemia, and glomerulonephritis may occur as well. CASE REPORT: We reported a case of hyperleukocytosis that developed due to prophylactic administration of lipegfilgrastim following the first course of neoadjuvant pertuzumab (840-420 mg), trastuzumab (8-6mg/kg), and docetaxel (75 mg/m2) in a 45-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of breast invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient, who presented with weakness, loss of appetite, and oral intake disorder, had elevated white blood cell (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and uric acid levels in her test results. Peripheral smear (PS) had a left shift. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Intravenous 0.9% NaCl and peroral allopurinol were started to be administered to the patient. On the ninth day of hospitalization, the patient's clinical manifestation improved, and her WBC, LDH, uric acid, and PS returned to normal. Besides, the progression to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was prevented by appropriate hydration and allopurinol treatment. In subsequent chemotherapies (CTs), lipegfilgrastim was discontinued and filgrastim was started. The patient whose hyperleukocytosis did not recur was operated on following neoadjuvant CT. The patient's routine follow-up continues without any problems.

With the extensive 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) immunization program, cases of GBS or MFS following vaccination are increasingly being reported. A 64-y-old Chinese man presented with new-onset paresthesia of the extremities, bilateral abduction limitation, right facial palsy, areflexia of bilateral lower limbs, and left-dominant limb ataxia 12 d after the second dose of inactivated vaccine against COVID-19. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated albumin-cytological dissociation and was positive for anti-GQ1b IgG and anti-GT1b IgG. Nerve conduction studies of limbs showed evidence of axonal neuropathy with reduced sensory amplitudes. Based on the clinical presentations, temporal progression of symptoms, and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of MFS-GBS overlap syndrome was made. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and acupuncture and made a complete recovery 54 d after the onset of his initial neurological signs. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of MFS-GBS overlap syndrome following the inactivated COVID-19 vaccination. However, a coincidental relationship with this inactivated vaccine cannot be excluded.

He had received his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer vaccine) 2 days prior. Electrocardiogram was consistent with pericarditis. He had persistently elevated troponins and globally reduced systolic function by echocardiogram, which was consistent with myocarditis. He received colchicine, ibuprofen, and proton pump inhibitors with a resolution of symptoms. After 32 days, follow-up echocardiogram had returned to normal, and his symptoms had resolved completely. DISCUSSION: Given the onset of symptoms after the second dose of vaccine and our review of similar cases in the literature, it seems likely the patient's myopericarditis was caused by the vaccine.

Vaccines are a very useful new tool against COVID-19 that stimulate the immune system after recognition of viruses or their parts. Complications post vaccination could happen and they depend on the types, vaccine mechanism of action as well as some other patients' factors. CASE REPORT: We are reporting a 39 years old lady who is known as allergic to a strawberry and kiwi, otherwise medically free. She presented to the outpatient unit with a ten-days history of palms of the hands and soles of the feet itchiness that is associated with occasional redness after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. There were no skin rashes or pruritis at any other sites. The patient was treated conservatively by antihistamine and the symptoms gradually resolved within five days. CONCLUSION: Allergic reaction is one of the expected complications post any COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 vaccination. Although the type, distributions and severity of allergic reactions are variable from person to another, yet isolated itching to palms and soles could be a rare side effect post first dose of COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech) which is worth reporting.

Recently, however, there have been many reports of herpes zoster after administration of COVID-19 vaccines, although initial trials showed that these vaccines have good safety and immunogenicity profiles. At the time of writing, about 5 billion people worldwide had received their full course of COVID-19 vaccination. This case report describes an elderly man who developed herpes zoster after receiving a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccine, with no adverse effects after the first and second dose. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old man with underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cerebrovascular disease presented with left-sided chest and upper back pain. The pain was intermittent, burning in nature, and disturbed his sleep. A week prior to his presentation, he received a COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) booster dose. Examination revealed multiple vesicles along his anterior and posterior T3 dermatome. He was diagnosed with herpes zoster and treated with a course of oral acyclovir. Upon review 7 days later, he had recovered well, with resolution of his vesicles and pain. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 vaccination remains an important measure to prevent transmission of infection and to reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by it. However, healthcare practitioners should be aware of the possible association between COVID-19 vaccination and herpes zoster.

With increased availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the awareness of possible side effects has expanded as reports surface. This study reviewed cases of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination and with existing literature on COVID-19 infection-induced myocarditis to compare clinical courses and analyze possible mechanisms of action. Methods: A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify published case reports (as of February 3, 2022) pertaining to the development of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination with either Pfizer or Moderna for an in-depth analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, past medical history, vaccine manufacturer, and dose number. Results: There were 53 eligible case reports that were included in this study. Patients were mostly male with a median age of 24 years, and the most reported symptom upon presentation was chest pain. Seventy percent of the cases involved the Pfizer vaccine with a majority of myocarditis developing subsequent to second dose. Resolution of symptoms was achieved in all but one patient. Clinical severity, as measured primarily by left ventricular ejection fraction, appeared to be worse among adult patients than pediatric, as well as for patients with comorbidities.

ImmunoglobulinG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a collection of systemic disorders that affect numerous organs and are also referred to as IgG4-associated sclerosing diseases. CD and IgG4-RD are difficult to separate because they may manifest similar commin clinical features. CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes a 53-year-old female who, during routine medical check-up, exhibited a progressive increase in serum globulin levels and a simultaneous worsening of anemia symptoms, raising concern for a clonal plasma cell disease such as myeloma. However, bone marrow punctures did not reveal any abnormal plasma cells. Also, serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis demonstrated no abnormal monoclonal protein bands. In addition, several laboratory findings excluded chronic liver disease, chronic infections caused by bacteria or viruses. Later, we found elevated serum IgG4 levels (10,700 mg/L), and identified multiple enlarged lymph nodes throughout the patient's body. Axillary lymph node aspiration revealed no abnormal lymphocytes, ruling out the possibility of lymphoma. Pathological morphology of the axillary lymph revealed a large number of plasma cells in the lymphatic follicles. In addition, there was a reduction in lymphatic follicle size and apoptosis of the germinal centres. Immunohistochemistry revealed IgG4+/IgG + in > 40% of cells, and more than 100 IgG4 + cells per high powered field (HPF) of specimen. As of now, finding strongly suggested IgG4-RD. This patient was treated with glucocorticoids and various immunosuppressive drugs, such as prednisone, cyclosporine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine. Unfortunately, the patient did not recover. Ultimately, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) was diagnosed in relation to the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory tests, and after combination chemotherapy (VCD: Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone), durable remission was achieved without serious adverse effects. During the follow-up period of one year and ten months, the patient remained stable. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of Castleman must be distinguished from other disorders such as IgG4-RD, malignant lymphoma, reactive hyperplasia of various lymph nodes (mostly caused by viral infections), plasmacytoma, advanced HIV and rheumatic diseases. Besides observing systemic symptoms, laboratory tests such as immunoglobulin levels, complement levels, interleukin levels, and C-reactive protein levels should also be performed in order to determine a diagnosis.",2023 Oct 2,20231002.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article discusses a case of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease and its differentiation from IgG4-related disease, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring."", 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease and its differentiation from IgG4-related disease, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,

We report a paired description of patients presenting with similar manifestations involving the central (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, suggesting that both may have triggered similar immune-mediated neurological disorders in the presence of anti-idiotype antibodies directed against the ACE2 protein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients exhibited overlapping neurological manifestations following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination: radiculitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and MRI-negative myelitis, respectively, sharing positivity for anti-ACE2 antibodies. Autoantibodies against AQP-4, MOG, GlyR, GAD, and amphiphysin, onconeural antibodies for CNS syndromes, and anti-ganglioside antibodies for PNS syndromes tested negative in all patients. DISCUSSION: Anti-idiotype antibodies against ACE2 have been detected in patients who recovered from COVID-19 infection, and it has been hypothesized that such antibodies may mediate adverse events following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, resulting in the activation of the immune system against cells expressing ACE2, such as neurons. Our data reveal clinically overlapping syndromes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, sharing positivity for anti-ACE2 antibodies.

COVID-19 infection has been associated with thyroid gland damage and disease SARS-CoV-2 direct action, euthyroid sick syndrome, and immune-mediated mechanisms are all potential mechanisms of thyroid damage. It denotes thyroid gland inflammation, most commonly of viral origin, and belongs to the transitory, self-limiting thyroid gland diseases group, causing complications in approximately 15% of patients in the form of permanent hypothyroidism. Some authors say SAT is the most common thyroid disease associated with COVID-19.Purpose: The occurrence of SAT many weeks after administering the second COVID-19 vaccine is rare and has limited documentation in academic literature. This study aims to present the occurrence of SAT after administering the COVID-19 vaccine. We present the case of a 37-year-old man who developed SAT 23 days after receiving the second dose of Pfizer BioNTech's COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.Research design and study sample: Due to neck pain and an elevated body temperature (up to 38.2 degrees C), a 37-year-old male subject presented for examination 23 days after receiving the second Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The patient denied ever having an autoimmune disease or any other disease. Painful neck palpation and a firm, slightly enlarged thyroid gland with no surrounding lymphadenopathy were identified during the exam. The heart rate was 104 beats per minute. All of the remaining physical findings were normal.Data collection and/or Analysis: Data collected during the disease are integral to the medical record.Results: Hematology and biochemistry analyses at the initial and follow-up visits revealed minor leukocytosis, normocytic anaemia, and thrombocytosis, followed by a mild increase in lactate dehydrogenase and decreased iron levels. The patient's thyroid function and morphology had recovered entirely from post-vaccine SAT.Conclusions: Results from this study emphasise the need for healthcare professionals to promptly report any case of SAT related to COVID-19 vaccination.

It frequently represents the best and the only choice in resistant schizophrenia. However, its use is feared by many professionals due to its possible adverse effects, such as eosinophilia. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a young white male suffering from treatment-resistant schizophrenia who rapidly developed eosinophilia after starting clozapine. DISCUSSION: We present a case of a 26-year-old white man diagnosed with schizophrenia with poor clinical response to several antipsychotics owing to which clozapine was started. Psychotic symptoms improved dramatically but a progressively ascendant eosinophilia was reported during serial haematological analyses. The patient remained physically asymptomatic. An exhaustive assessment with ancillary diagnostic tests revealed no cause for eosinophilia. Thus, a diagnosis of clozapine-induced eosinophilia was made. The drug was discontinued and eosinophil count progressively returned to normal but psychotic symptoms worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine treatment is frequently feared due to its possible side effects and complications, delaying its use in refractory schizophrenia. Also, to our knowledge, there are no specific guidelines on how to manage haematological side effects such as eosinophilia. This is problematic as, in some cases, it may lead to an unnecessary withdrawal of clozapine with a worsening of psychotic symptoms.

Although largely well tolerated, lithium has a wide spectrum of adverse effects in different organs and seems to also cause taste and smell disorders, which remain rare and not largely described. We aim to present a rare case of hyposmia and dysgeusia secondary to lithium treatment in a bipolar patient and also conduct a review on these rare lithium adverse effects. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 43-year-old woman with type I bipolar disorder who became stabilized and fully functional with lithium therapy. After 4 months of treatment, she began to notice progressive hyposmia and dysgeusia. After multiple diagnostic and screening tests, lithium was implicated as the cause of the symptoms, which led to a switch to valproic acid. After 3 months, she was not compensated with valproic acid treatment, returned to lithium therapy despite its adverse effects, and became stabilized again. CONCLUSIONS: There are few data on lithium therapy taste and smell adverse effects. Most studies on this topic are likely to be case reports. Lithium therapy may cause dysgeusia and hyposmia, although mechanisms are not fully understood. These adverse effects can interfere negatively in patient's treatment adherence. Therefore, physicians who prescribe lithium should be aware of them.

C5-complement inhibitors are effective treatments for acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR ab) positive generalized MG. We describe the use of eculizumab/ravulizumab in two patients with MG receiving concomitant pembrolizumab. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of two medical records. RESULTS: Patient 1: An 80-year-old male with recurrent, non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder developed ICI-induced AChR ab positive MG (ICI-MG), myositis, and myocarditis 2 weeks after the first dose of pembrolizumab. Myositis responded to corticosteroids. MG responded to eculizumab, followed by ravulizumab. He died of metastatic cancer 8 months later. Patient 2: A 58-year-old male had refractory thymoma-associated AChR ab-positive MG, which responded to eculizumab. He developed metastatic Merkel cell cancer necessitating pembrolizumab. MG remained stable on eculizumab. He had no irAEs for 22 months, with positron emission tomographic resolution of cancer. He then developed mild, indolent retinal vasculitis, which responded to prednisone. Discontinuation of pembrolizumab for 5 months resulted in cancer recurrence; pembrolizumab was resumed with peri-infusion pulse prednisone. MG remained stable and he continues eculizumab.

At low doses, it blocks histamine-1 (H1) receptors having a hypnotic effect. Unusual but potentially severe side effects of trazodone include suicidal behavior, excess sedation, QT prolongation, and priapism. Three case studies have been published in the last four decades describing trazodone-induced parkinsonism. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on amiodarone), major depressive disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and obstructive sleep apnea, was prescribed trazodone for his chronic insomnia. After 1 month, he was seen in the emergency department (ED) with complaints of coarse tremors of his upper extremities and could not write with a pen anymore due to shaking. He noticed dragging of his feet while walking for over a month, which caused him to have multiple falls and significantly impacted his activities of daily living. On clinical exam, the patient had bilateral cogwheel rigidity in ankles and shuffling gait. Trazodone was discontinued, and his symptoms resolved within a week. CONCLUSION: Trazodone was likely causing parkinsonism in our patient. Amiodarone may have hindered trazodone metabolism causing higher levels in blood. Multiple mechanisms of trazodone's effect on dopamine have been suggested, but the serotonin-dopamine system interaction remains significant. Physicians need to contemplate the benefits and detriments before adding more medications to the list for older adults. Polypharmacy can amplify the adverse effects of a drug that might not be seen in everyday practice.",2022 Apr,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on trazodone-induced parkinsonism.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on trazodone-induced parkinsonism.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses trazodone-induced parkinsonism, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses trazodone-induced parkinsonism, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Adverse effects including asterixis and myoclonus have been described in patients with chronic kidney disease, but myokymia has not been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man with a history of traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia, and posttraumatic stress disorder presented to the hospital after multiple falls attributed to acute onset muscle spasms. He reported taking a total daily dose of 9600 mg of gabapentin, as prescribed. Physical examination demonstrated stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, painful muscle spasms in all extremities, and myokymia in his bilateral calves. Diffuse action tremors, as well as tongue tremors, were also observed.Initial workup, including basic laboratory investigations, brain imaging, and electroencephalogram, was unrevealing. Gabapentin toxicity was suspected, and a gabapentin holiday was initiated with the improvement of myokymia by hospital day 3. The patient was found to have a high gabapentin level (25.8 mug/mL; reference range, 2.0-20.0 mug/mL) measured the morning after hospital presentation. After restarting on a lower dose of gabapentin with multimodal pain control, the patient continued to improve with diminution of his myoclonus, tremor, and gait instability. CONCLUSIONS: Myokymia is a newly described motor symptom associated with gabapentin toxicity. The mechanism of gabapentin-associated myokymia is currently unknown. A brief medication holiday resulted in the resolution of motor symptoms without significant withdrawal symptoms.

34794709,PMC8556627,Hospital staff members' preferences about who should be prioritized to receive the COVID-19 vaccine: People with or without Alzheimer's disease?,AboJabel H||Idilbi N||Werner P,"Background There is no doubt that people with dementia can greatly benefit from the COVID-19 vaccine, especially as they are at an increased risk of developing severe complications, including long hospitalizations and high mortality rates, as a result of being infected by the virus. However, they might need the encouragement of health professionals to become vaccinated. Professionals' preferences regarding vaccination for this group are, therefore, extremely important to increase the use of this preventive measure. Aims 1. To examine hospital staff members' preferences for COVID-19 vaccination to people with or without Alzheimer's disease (AD) while differentiating between a young and an old person with the disease. 2. To examine the factors associated with these preferences. Methods A cross-sectional survey using a structured and anonymous self-report questionnaire was conducted among a sample of 278 Israeli medical staff (nurses, physicians, and paraprofessionals) working at a general hospital. The data were collected in August 2021. Results Overall, the majority (68.4%) of participants chose the 80-year-old patient with a diagnosis of AD to be the last to receive the vaccine. The percentage of participants who preferred to give the vaccine first to the 55-year-old patient with AD was almost equal to the percentage of those who preferred giving the vaccine first to the 80-year-old patient who was cognitively intact. Religion and beliefs about susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 were significantly associated with participants' preferences. Conclusion Our results suggest that hospital staff members find it difficult to decide whether age or cognitive status should be the main factor in deciding which patient should receive the vaccine first. Therefore, there is a need to implement several policy and practical steps in hospitals to assist the medical staff in such decision-making processes.",2021 Dec,20211030.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The abstract does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article focuses on hospital staff preferences regarding the prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination for patients with or without Alzheimer's disease, rather than discussing complications or adverse effects of the vaccine itself."", 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article focuses on hospital staff preferences regarding the prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination for patients with or without Alzheimer's disease, rather than discussing complications or adverse effects of the vaccine itself.",2,90,,

MFS is usually preceded by viral infections and febrile illness; however, only a few cases have been reported after vaccinations. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old hypertensive male presented with a 2-day history of progressive ascending paralysis of the lower limbs along with diplopia and ataxia, 8 days after the first dose of the Sinovac-Coronavac coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, with no prior history of any predisposing infections or triggers. DIAGNOSES: Physical examination showed moderate motor and sensory loss with areflexia in the lower limbs bilaterally. Routine blood investigations and radiological investigations were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed albuminocytologic dissociation and nerve conduction studies revealed prolonged latencies with reduced conduction velocities. The diagnosis of MFS was established based on the findings of physical examination, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and nerve conduction studies. INTERVENTIONS: A management plan was devised based on intravenous immunoglobulins, pregabalin, and physiotherapy. However, due to certain socioeconomic factors, the patient was managed conservatively with regular physiotherapy sessions. OUTCOMES: Follow-up after 6 weeks showed remarkable improvement, with complete resolution of symptoms 10 weeks after the discharge. LESSONS: This case suggests that MFS is a rare adverse effect after COVID-19 vaccination and additional research is required to substantiate a temporal association. Further studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology behind such complications to enhance the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations in the future.",2022 May 20,20220520.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of Miller Fisher syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination, which is an adverse effect.', 'score': 1}","The article discusses a case of Miller Fisher syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination, which is an adverse effect.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of Miller Fisher syndrome occurring after COVID-19 vaccination, which directly addresses complications or adverse effects of the vaccination, thus meeting the criteria.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of Miller Fisher syndrome occurring after COVID-19 vaccination, which directly addresses complications or adverse effects of the vaccination, thus meeting the criteria.",1,90,"{'complications': ['Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS)', 'progressive ascending paralysis', 'diplopia', 'ataxia', 'areflexia']}","['Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS)', 'progressive ascending paralysis', 'diplopia', 'ataxia', 'areflexia']"

It is clinically mirrored by the occurrence of exacerbations of complement mediated diseases during COVID-19 infection. These include complement-mediated hemolytic anemias such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), particularly cold agglutinin disease (CAD), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). All these conditions may benefit from complement inhibitors that are also under study for COVID-19 disease. Hemolytic exacerbations in these conditions may occur upon several triggers including infections and vaccines and may require transfusions, treatment with complement inhibitors and/or immunosuppressors (i.e., steroids and rituximab for AIHA), and result in thrombotic complications. In this manuscript we describe four patients (2 with PNH and 2 with CAD) who experienced hemolytic flares after either COVID-19 infection or SARS-Cov2 vaccine and provide a review of the most recent literature. We report that most episodes occurred within the first 10 days after COVID-19 infection/vaccination and suggest laboratory monitoring (Hb and LDH levels) in that period. Moreover, in our experience and in the literature, hemolytic exacerbations occurring during COVID-19 infection were more severe, required greater therapeutic intervention, and carried more complications including fatalities, as compared to those developing after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, suggesting the importance of vaccinating this patient population. Patient education remains pivotal to promptly recognize signs/symptoms of hemolytic flares and to refer to medical attention. Treatment choice should be based on the severity of the hemolytic exacerbation as well as of that of COVID-19 infection. Therapies include transfusions, complement inhibitor initiation/additional dose in the case of PNH, steroids/rituximab in patients with CAD and warm type AIHA, plasma exchange, hemodialysis and complement inhibitor in the case of atypical HUS. Finally, anti-thrombotic prophylaxis should be always considered in these settings, provided safe platelet counts.",2021,20211125.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract explicitly mentions hemolytic flares occurring after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, thus meeting the specified criteria.', 'score': 1}","The abstract explicitly mentions hemolytic flares occurring after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, thus meeting the specified criteria.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses hemolytic exacerbations in patients with complement-mediated hemolytic anemias following COVID-19 infection or vaccination, indicating complications related to the vaccine, thus meeting the criteria.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses hemolytic exacerbations in patients with complement-mediated hemolytic anemias following COVID-19 infection or vaccination, indicating complications related to the vaccine, thus meeting the criteria.",1,90,"{'complications': ['thrombotic complications', 'fatalities', 'hemolytic exacerbations', 'greater therapeutic intervention', 'severe hemolytic exacerbations']}","['thrombotic complications', 'fatalities', 'hemolytic exacerbations', 'greater therapeutic intervention', 'severe hemolytic exacerbations']"

Surveillance of rare safety issues related to these vaccines is progressing, since more granular data emerge about adverse events of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during post-marketing surveillance. Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation has already been reported in COVID-19 patients. In addition, adverse events after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination have also been in the context of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation and directly associated with the mRNA vaccine. We present the first case of CMV reactivation and pericarditis in temporal association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly adenovirus-based DNA vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against SARS-CoV-2. After initiation of antiviral therapy with oral valganciclovir, CMV viremia disappeared and clinical symptoms rapidly improved. Since huge vaccination programs are ongoing worldwide, post-marketing surveillance systems must be in place to assess vaccine safety that is important for the detection of any events. In the context of the hundreds of millions of individuals to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, a potential causal association with CMV reactivation may result in a considerable number of cases with potentially severe complications.",2021,20220118.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract explicitly discusses a case of CMV reactivation and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, thus representing an adverse effect.', 'score': 1}","The abstract explicitly discusses a case of CMV reactivation and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, thus representing an adverse effect.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of cytomegalovirus reactivation and pericarditis following vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which directly addresses complications and adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of cytomegalovirus reactivation and pericarditis following vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which directly addresses complications and adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",1,90,"{'complications': ['Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation', 'Pericarditis', 'CMV viremia']}","['Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation', 'Pericarditis', 'CMV viremia']"

With the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 patients, it is imperative to explore the factors related to the disease to aid patient management until a definitive vaccine is ready, as the disease is not limited to the respiratory system alone. COVID-19 has been associated with various cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The infection is severe in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and a systemic inflammatory response due to a cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases can lead to acute myocardial infarction. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 56-year-old man with cardiovascular risk factors including coronary artery disease, hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperlipidemia, who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. He subsequently developed myocardial infarction during his hospitalization at our facility. He had a significant contact history for COVID-19. He was managed with emergent cardiac revascularization after COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing from a nasopharyngeal swab as per hospital policy for admitted patients. Apart from dual antiplatelet therapy, tocilizumab therapy was initiated due to the high interleukin-6 levels. His hospitalization was complicated by hemodialysis and failed extubation and intubation, resulting in a tracheostomy. Upon improvement, he was discharged to a long-term facility with a plan for outpatient follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic, clinical, morphological characteristics, outcomes, and timing of development of herpes zoster to the various COVID-19 vaccines. And to identify on whether COVID-19 vaccine has temporal relationship between development of herpes zoster (HZ). METHODS: We have performed a systemic review of articles from PubMed and Embase using MeSH and keywords like ""Shingles,"" ""Herpes zoster,"" ""Varicella zoster,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""Vaccine,"" ""SARS-CoV-2.""

She was in her usual state of health when she has received the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (June 2021). Seven days later, she started reporting intense thirst and polyuria and consulted her family physician. BLOOD ANALYSIS: creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, glucose 95mg/dL, Na+ 141mEq/L, K+ 3.9 mEq/L, TSH 3.8 mcUI/L (0.38-5.33), FT4 0.9 ng/dL (0.6-1.1), cortisol 215.4 nmol/L (185-624), ACTH 21.9 pg/mL (6- 48), FSH 4.76 UI/L, LH5.62 UI/L, estradiol 323 pmol/L, IGF1 74.8 ng/mL (88-209), PRL 24.7mcg/L (3.3-26.7) osmolality 298.2 mOs/Kg (250- 325); Urine analysis: volume 10200 mL/24h, osmolality 75 mOs/Kg (300-900), density 1.002. On water restriction test: 0' - Serum osmolality 308.8mOsm/Kg vs. urine osmolality 61.0 mOsm/Kg; 60' - urine osmolality 102 mOsm/Kg; urine osmolality 1 h after desmopressine was 511mOsm/kg.

She came to the emergency department after her left eyelid swelled unexpectedly two hours later, accompanied by itching and redness. Aside from left eyelid edema and redness, there were no other remarkable bilateral ocular findings. The lack of recent history of any cause of eyelid edema suggested a vaccine-induced ocular allergy.

OBJECTIVE: To describe ocular adverse events that occur soon after receiving an inactivated COVID-19 vaccination (Sinopharm). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series took place from September 2020 to January 2021 at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, a tertiary referral center. Patients who reported ocular adverse events and presented within 15 days from the first of 2 doses of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Each patient underwent Snellen best-corrected visual acuity that was then converted to logMAR, applanation tonometry, and biomicroscopic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy. Color fundus photography was obtained with a conventional 9-field fundus photography camera or with a widefield fundus photography system. Optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomographic angiography images were obtained. Sex, race, age, and clinical data were self-reported. RESULTS: Nine eyes of 7 patients (3 male individuals) presenting with ocular complaints following COVID-19 vaccine were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 41.4 (9.3) years (range, 30-55 years); the mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.23 logMAR (range, 0-1 logMAR; approximate Snellen equivalent, 20/32).

The typical treatment for CPI-triggered diabetes is insulin, but a detailed therapeutic method has not yet been established. To prevent severe symptoms and mortality of diabetic ketoacidosis in advanced-stage cancer patients, the establishment of effective treatment of CPI-triggered diabetes, other than insulin therapy, is required. METHODS: We present a case of a 76-year-old man with CPI-triggered diabetes who was treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab for lung cancer. We also conducted a systematic review of 48 case reports of type 1 diabetes associated with nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy before June 2023. RESULTS: The patient's hyperglycemia was not sufficiently controlled by insulin therapy, and after the remission of ketoacidosis, the addition of a sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, improved glycemic control. Most of the reported nivolumab/ipilimumab-induced type 1 diabetes was treatable with insulin, but very few cases required additional oral anti-diabetic agents to obtain good glucose control. CONCLUSION: Although SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported to have adverse effects on ketoacidosis, recent studies indicate that the occurrence of ketoacidosis is relatively rare. Considering the pathological mechanism of CPI-triggered diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors could be an effective choice if they are administered while carefully monitoring the patient's ketoacidosis.",2023,20231201.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Though vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a rare complication after vaccination with recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines, it can lead to severe complications. In vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the vector vaccine induces heparin-independent production of platelet factor 4 autoantibodies, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation. Therefore, patients suffering from vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia particularly present with signs of arterial or venous thrombosis, often at atypical sites, but also signs of bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and severe thrombocytopenia. We describe herein a rare case of fulminant portomesenteric thrombosis and atraumatic splenic rupture due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. This case report presents the diagnosis and treatment of a healthy 29-year-old male Caucasian patient suffering from an extended portomesenteric thrombosis associated with atraumatic splenic rupture due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the first dose of an adenoviral vector vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)]. Therapeutic management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia initially focused on systemic anticoagulation avoiding heparin and the application of steroids and intravenous immune globulins as per the recommendations of international societies of hematology and hemostaseology. Owing to the atraumatic splenic rupture and extended portomesenteric thrombosis, successful management of this case required splenectomy with additional placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to perform local thrombaspiration, plus repeated local lysis to reconstitute hepatopetal blood flow. CONCLUSION: The complexity and wide spectrum of the clinical picture in patients suffering from vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia demand an early interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Severe cases of portomesenteric thrombosis in vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, refractory to conservative management, may require additional placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, thrombaspiration, thrombolysis, and surgical intervention for effective management.",2022 Jul 11,20220711.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract explicitly discusses a case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a serious adverse effect following COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 1}","The abstract explicitly discusses a case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a serious adverse effect following COVID-19 vaccination.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a rare case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia as a complication following vaccination against COVID-19, which directly addresses the criteria of complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a rare case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia as a complication following vaccination against COVID-19, which directly addresses the criteria of complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",1,90,"{'complications': ['vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia', 'fulminant portomesenteric thrombosis', 'atraumatic splenic rupture', 'disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'severe thrombocytopenia']}","['vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia', 'fulminant portomesenteric thrombosis', 'atraumatic splenic rupture', 'disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'severe thrombocytopenia']"

A case report and literature review.,Licciardi M||Utzeri E||Marchetti MF||Nissardi V||Cecchetto G||Montisci M||Montisci R,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most consumed drug worldwide and number of users is increasing, particularly among youth. Moreover, cannabis potential therapeutic properties have renewed interest to make it available as a treatment for a variety of conditions. Albeit rarely, cannabis consumption has been associated with cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction (MI) and potentially sudden death. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department sent by her cardiologist because of a recent finding of a 16 seconds asystole on the implantable loop recorder (ILR) she implanted 7 months before for recurrent syncopes. She declared that she is a heavy cannabis user (at least 5 cannabis-cigarette per day, not mixed up with tobacco, for no less than 12 years) and all syncopes occurred shortly after cannabis consumption. After a collective discussion with the heart team, syncope unit, electrophysiologists and toxicologist, we decided to implant a dual chamber pacemaker with a rate response algorithm due to the high risk of trauma of the syncopal episodes. 24 months follow-up period was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis cardiovascular effects are not well known and, although rare, among these we find ischemic episodes, tachyarrhythmias, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, ventricular asystole and possibly death. Because of cannabis growing consumption both for medical and recreational purpose, cardiovascular diseases associated with cannabis use may become more and more frequent. In the light of the poor literature, we believe that cannabis may produce opposite adverse effects depending on the duration of the habit. Acute administration increases sympathetic tone and reduces parasympathetic tone; conversely, with chronic intake an opposite effect is observed: repetitive dosing decreases sympathetic activity and increases parasympathetic activity. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of cardiovascular complications associated with cannabis use and should investigate its consumption especially in young patients presenting with cardiac dysrhythmias.",2023 Oct 25,20231025.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the cardiovascular effects of cannabis use, not on complications of COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on the cardiovascular effects of cannabis use, not on complications of COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the cardiovascular effects and complications associated with cannabis use, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the cardiovascular effects and complications associated with cannabis use, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.",2,95,,

ITP is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first studies of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, there were no reports of ITP and the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was low overall. Here, we present a case of ITP as a complication of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. CASE REPORT Three days after receiving a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old woman presented with a petechial rash on her trunk, legs, and arms, and fatigue and muscle aches. At the time of her hospital admission, her platelet count was 1000/microL. A peripheral smear showed profound thrombocytopenia. During the course of the patient's hospitalization, she was treated with 2 units of platelets, 2 infusions of i.v. immunoglobulin, and i.v. methylprednisolone. Her platelet count increased to 92 000/microL on the day of discharge and she was prescribed a tapered dose of oral prednisone. One day later, her rash had resolved and her platelet count was 243 000/microL. The patient recovered completely with no complications.

Therefore, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have recently emerged as an important measure to fight the pandemic. ChAdOx1-S (Oxford-AstraZeneca) is an adenovirus-vectored vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It shows an acceptable safety profile. Nevertheless, several cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported after initial vaccination with ChAdOx1-S mimicking autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This condition has been called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and complications such as intracerebral haemorrhage have been described. CASE REPORT: We present a case of intracerebral haemorrhage after ChAdOx1-S vaccination. Middle-aged patient with no prior medical history was seen in the emergency room 16 days after the first dose of ChAdOx1-S vaccine with sudden onset left hemiplegia and severe holocranial oppressive headache. She did not receive heparin treatment in the previous 100 days. Blood test showed moderate thrombocytopenia and a right frontal lobar haemorrhage was seen on computed tomography scan, computed tomography venography was negative for thrombosis. The presence of antibodies against platelet factor 4 was confirmed. The patient's neurological condition progressively worsened. She developed a treatment resistant intracranial hypertension syndrome and she died three weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: TTS is a rare adverse effect of ChAdOx1-S vaccine, defined by the presence of thrombosis in uncommon locations. In our case we report an spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage probable due to the thrombocytopenia related to probable TTS.

A 59-year-old woman who was undergoing peritoneal dialysis presented with peritonitis with abdominal pain and turbid peritoneal dialysis. Empiric intraperitoneal cefazolin in combination with cefoperazone and sulbactam was started after peritoneal dialysis effluent cultures were performed.

It is caused by an immunologic reaction between autoantibodies and hemidesmosome proteins of epithelial cells. The disease is characterized by a symmetrical blister distribution on the body. Diagnosis should be suspected in elderly patients presenting with a tense blister on normal-appearing skin or on an erythematous base. In the literature, several forms of typical bullous pemphigoid after treatment with linagliptin have been reported. However, this is the first reported case of atypical nonbullous pemphigoid after linagliptin intake. CASE REPORT A 77-year-old woman presented with multiple erythematous papules and nodules on the upper extremities and trunk. The patient was being treated with linagliptin for diabetes. Diagnosis was made with biopsy and histopathological studies, followed by direct immunofluorescence. The histopathological study showed a subepidermal blister with an underlying polymorphous infiltrate, mainly of an eosinophilic profile. Direct immunofluorescence showed linear IgG and C3 antibodies to hemidesmosomes at the lamina lucida of the basement membrane. Thus, the diagnosis of atypical nonbullous pemphigoid was made. CONCLUSIONS This report emphasizes the great variety of bullous pemphigoid presentation and the need for a greater level of awareness of the adverse effects of linagliptin.

The disorder is thought to involve the trochlea/superior oblique tendon complex through traumatic, surgical, and inflammatory mechanisms. It could be an indication of multiple underlying immunological or rheumatological disorders. PURPOSE: This study aimed to report an unusual strabismus after receiving the first dose of a live attenuated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old female patient presented with painful vertical diplopia and tenderness of the left trochlear area 3 days after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. She had a compensatory chin elevation and face turn to the right, as well as a left 10-prism-diopter hypotropia in the primary position, which increased to 15 prism diopters in the right gaze and disappeared in the left gaze. Ocular motility revealed the limitation of elevation on adduction. The patient denied any history of ocular trauma and was consequently investigated for dysthyroid disease and various immunological and rheumatological disorders, which were excluded. A Hess chart was obtained to document the motility disorder. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of acquired Brown syndrome in a 31-year-old otherwise healthy woman shortly after COVID-19 vaccination.

Several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been developed to limit the progression and complications of the disease. These treatments provide immediate and passive immunity. The combination therapy with Bamlanivimab plus Etesevimab led to a lower incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death and a faster reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. No or rare cases of cardiovascular side effects are reported. We present the case of a high-risk 79-years-old woman who developed atrial fibrillation with aberrant ventricular conduction after administration of neutralizing monoclonal-antibodies Bamlanivimab plus Etesevimab. The woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes and Grade II follicular Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma previously vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, presented with malaise, headache, and SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tested positive for the infection. She received a single dose of Bamlanivimab (70 mg) + Etesevimab (1400 mg). After about a week, she developed atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled response to frequent premature ventricular complexes and aberrant ventricular conduction. This case presents a high-risk woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed a serious adverse cardiovascular event some days after receiving neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Risk factors including sex, age, anxiety related to isolation and infection, and COVID-19 itself may have all contributed to atrial fibrillation.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of intestinal microecological transplantation for treating patients with chronic radiation enteritis. CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old female with cervical cancer developed abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the stool 1 year after radiotherapy. An electronic colonoscopy was performed to diagnose chronic radiation enteritis. Two courses of intestinal microecological transplantation and full-length 16S rRNA microbiological analysis were performed. The patient experienced short- and long-term relief from symptoms without adverse effects. Whole 16S rRNA sequencing revealed significant differences in the intestinal flora's composition between patient and healthy donors. Pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia fergusonii and Romboutsia timonensis, were more in the patient. Beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Ruminococcus bromii, and Bifidobacterium longum were more in the healthy donors. Intestinal microbiota transplantation resulted in a significant change in the patient's intestinal flora composition. The composition converged with the donor's flora, with an increase in core beneficial intestinal bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale, and a decrease in pathogenic bacteria. Changes in the intestinal flora corresponded with the patients' alleviating clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: Intestinal microecological transplantation is an effective treatment for relieving the clinical symptoms of chronic radiation enteritis by altering the composition of the intestinal flora.

Molecular mimicry and vaccine adjuvants appear to be important contributors to immune-mediated neuropathies. However, whether the link between the COVID-19 vaccine and these autoimmune disorders is coincidental or causal remains uncertain. We describe the ever-reported case of acute-onset CIDP following the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in Tunisia. The patient is a 41-year-old man who presented with acute, worsening weakness of the four limbs. The symptoms appeared 15 days after his first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The diagnosis of GBS was initially confirmed according to the clinical features, the albumino-cytological dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the electroneuromyography (ENMG) findings. Serum workup for all known infections associated with immune-mediated neuropathy was negative. The patient was treated with plasma exchange without initial improvement followed by aggravation of the symptomatology after an interval of four and a half months. Control ENMG showed signs of CIDP meeting the European Academy of Neurology/Peripheral Nerve Society (EAN/PNS) criteria of 2021. The patient was treated with maintenance intravenous immunoglobulin and oral corticosteroids. Neurological examination 3 months after discharge showed partial improvement. Worldwide, cases of demyelinating polyneuropathies post-COVID-19 vaccination are increasingly reported. The acute onset of CIDP might lead to a misdiagnosis of GBS. Awareness of this complication and distinction from GBS enables early relay with maintenance treatment to prevent relapses and severe complications.

38978077,PMC11232331,Androgen transition and management of hereditary angioedema long-term prophylaxis in real life: a single-center case series.,Hoarau C||Maleki A||Bouillet L||Boccon-Gibod I,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease that manifests clinically as recurrent episodes of swelling affecting multiple anatomical locations. Long-term prophylaxis (LTP) aims to control the disease by preventing HAE attacks. Previously, treatments such as attenuated androgens have been used for LTP, but they have an unfavorable adverse effect profile. Today, these limitations may be overcome by patients transitioning to newer, targeted therapies including oral berotralstat and subcutaneous lanadelumab. This case series reports the transition process between different prophylactic therapies in a family with HAE in a real-world setting. RESULTS: Four adult patient cases from the same family who underwent transitions in HAE prophylaxis are presented. Three were female and one male. Two patients who transitioned to berotralstat were initially prescribed attenuated androgens. Two patients were not taking LTP at the time of initiating targeted treatment but had previously been prescribed tranexamic acid. The length of transition varied between the patients, with the longest time taken to stabilize on new therapy being 26 months. All patients received regular follow-up in person or by telephone and all four required an adjustment from their initial treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning between LTP in HAE may help improve control of attacks, avoid unwanted adverse effects, or better cater to individual patient preferences. Newer targeted therapies have been shown to be effective and should be discussed with patients. Shared decision-making is a tool that can aid these discussions. The transition journey between LTP therapies in HAE may not be straightforward and is specific to each patient. Physicians should consider complicating factors such as patient anxieties around changing treatment, adverse effects, preferred routes of administration, and speed of transition. Following patients closely during the transition period helps identify any issues, including difficulties with treatment adherence, and may allow the transition plan to be adapted when necessary.",2024 Jul 9,20240709.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the management and transition of long-term prophylaxis in hereditary angioedema, focusing on treatment options and patient experiences, but does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the management and transition of long-term prophylaxis in hereditary angioedema, focusing on treatment options and patient experiences, but does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,90,,

Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy affecting the peripheral nerve roots, which is not well described as a post-vaccination side effect. Here, we present a rare complication of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, reaching a diagnosis of CIDP. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old diabetic male presented with lower extremity paresthesia and weakness following the third dose of the Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) vaccine. Despite initial dismissal as a diabetic complication, symptoms escalated, affecting all extremities. Electromyography study revealed abnormal spontaneous activity with chronic reinnervation changes, which was more significant in the lower extremities. Based on the clinical course, radiographic imaging, and laboratory data, a diagnosis of CIDP with severe axonal demyelinating features was established. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), prednisolone, and azathioprine resulted in marked improvement of the upper extremities but limited recovery in distal lower extremity muscles.

38643357,PMC11055466,Successful Treatment of Lithium-Induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus with Celecoxib: A Promising Therapeutic Option.,Hashikawa R||Yamada H||Fujii T||Ohtsuru S,"BACKGROUND Nephrogenic diabetic insipidus (NDI) poses a challenge in clinical management, particularly when associated with lithium ingestion. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used for the treatment of numerous diseases worldwide, including NDI. However, many studies have reported the diverse adverse effects of long-term use of non-selective NSAIDs. Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a better drug to relieve pain and inflammation in terms of long-term safety and efficacy than non-selective NSAIDs. Nevertheless, there are few reports describing the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating NDI. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 46-year-old woman with schizophrenia who presented with severe hypernatremia and refractory polyuria due to lithium-induced NDI. Cessation of lithium ingestion and traditional treatments, including trichlormethiazide and desmopressin, yielded minimal improvement in her hypernatremia and polyuria. Her sodium level needed to be strictly controlled with the infusion of dextrose 5% in water. Given the safety of celecoxib, we decided to initiate celecoxib as the treatment of lithium-induced NDI instead of indomethacin. Notably, the introduction of celecoxib led to a substantial and sustained amelioration of polyuria and hypernatremia without any celecoxib-associated adverse effects. Even after transfer to another hospital, stability in serum sodium levels persisted with celecoxib. CONCLUSIONS We presented a case of lithium-induced NDI successfully treated with celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful treatment of lithium-induced NDI with celecoxib, and suggests celecoxib is a viable therapeutic option warranting further exploration. Physicians should consider its use when faced with the challenging management of lithium-induced NDI.",2024 Apr 21,20240421.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with celecoxib and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the treatment of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with celecoxib and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

It is a rare adverse effect with an incidence of 1 case per 100 000 exposures. The disorder represents altered immune response with proliferation of antibodies that bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to formation of thrombi and consumptive coagulopathy. Thrombosis combined with thrombocytopenia generally occurs in the first month following vaccination and can lead to fatal outcome, even in young, previously healthy individuals. These young adults ultimately may become solid organ donors. The main concerns with vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia solid organ donors are anti-PF4 antibodies transmission potential, risk of early major graft thrombosis, and serious bleeding. CASE REPORT In our center, 2 kidney transplantations were performed from a single brain-dead vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia donor following Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 (Janssen) vaccine in October 2021, which represents the first 2 cases of kidney transplantation from a deceased vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia donor after immunization with Ad26.COV2-S (Janssen) vaccine. Both recipients were closely monitored in the early post-transplantation period and after discharge from the hospital. To date, both recipients have a good functioning allograft, without any evidence of vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia transmission.

Mesotheliomas are tumors that develop from mesothelial surfaces, with the pleura being the most common, followed by the peritoneum. The diagnosis of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) is usually established when the disease is advanced, owing to the nonspecific clinical appearance and abdominal symptoms. Initially, MPM was treated with palliative systemic chemotherapy, with or without palliative surgery. However, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with bidirectional intraoperative chemotherapy (BDIC) has recently emerged as a treatment option for MPM. BDIC creates a bidirectional chemotherapy gradient in the peritoneal tumor cells through the simultaneous use of intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy. CRS, combined with BDIC (CRS-BDIC), allows the complete elimination of residual tiny tumor cells after complete removal of the visible tumor nodules. CASE REPORT Herein, we present a case of a 51-year-old woman with MPM and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b. Her treatment consisted of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, followed by CRS-BDIC using intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin, and intravenous ifosfamide. The surgery was successful, with no immediate complications or decline in the patient's kidney function. On follow up 2 months later, the patient denies suffering any chemotherapy-related adverse effects, and her kidney profile remains stable.

32545989,,Rosuvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis due to medication errors.,Vodicka M||Slanar O||Pisar M||Salek T,"Case (description): A 74 years old Caucasian suffering from chronic kidney disease presented with progressive asthenia and diffuse myalgia. It was revealed that the patient used three different rosuvastatin-containing preparations in a total daily dose of 120 mg for 76 days. Laboratory investigations revealed a marked elevation of serum urea, creatinine, myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK) and transaminases. Two serious medication errors have been identified as possible major factors that synergistically contributed to the development of rosuvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. First, 40 mg of rosuvastatin dose was prescribed to the patient, although the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined below 40 ml/min/1.73 m2. Moreover, the patient used 3 different rosuvastatin formulations simultaneously in a total dose of 120 mg/day. The heterozygous CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype and warfarin co-administration could further contribute to the development of rhabdomyolysis. A number of preventive measures, notably in drug policy, are suggested to overcome unintended intoxications. Conclusion: Rosuvastatin-induced myopathy is a rare, but serious adverse effect. This case report highlights the need for a proper treatment and dose adjustment during chronic medical therapy, the need for adequate patient education and application of adequate drug policy measures in the era of fragmented health care delivery and polypragmasia.",2020 Spring,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of rhabdomyolysis induced by medication errors related to rosuvastatin, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of rhabdomyolysis induced by medication errors related to rosuvastatin, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,
38143763,PMC10739420,Case Report: CD19 CAR T-cell therapy following autologous stem cell transplantation: a successful treatment for R/R CD20-negative transformed follicular lymphoma with TP53 mutation.,Zhang J||Cai D||Gao R||Miao Y||Cui Y||Liu Z||Zhang H||Yan X||Su N,"BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma (FL), a common indolent B-cell lymphoma, has the potential to transform into an aggressive lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The outcome of patients with transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL) is poor, especially in patients with transformed lymphoma after chemotherapy and patients with progression within 24 months (POD24). Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy combined with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has promising antitumor efficacy. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we described a 39-year-old male patient who was initially diagnosed with FL that transformed into DLBCL with POD24, CD20 negativity, TP53 mutation, and a bulky mass after 3 lines of therapy, all of which were adverse prognostic factors. We applied a combination approach: CD19 CAR T-cell infusion following ASCT. Ibrutinib was administered continuously to enhance efficacy, DHAP was administered as a salvage chemotherapy, and ICE was administered as a bridging regimen. The patient underwent BEAM conditioning on days -7~ -1, a total of 3.8 x 10(6/)kg CD34(+) stem cells were infused on days 01~02, and a total of 10(8) CAR T cells (relmacabtagene autoleucel, relma-cel, JWCAR029) were infused on day 03. The patient experienced grade 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), manifesting as fever and hypotension according to institutional standards. There was no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) after CAR T-cell infusion. Finally, the patient achieved CMR at +1 month, which has been maintained without any other adverse effects.

Many physicians have not been exposed to the rare, but implicit, complications, revealing a glaring need for updated evidence and re-examination. We present a case of a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive male patient who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with vaccinia symptoms several days after receiving the JYNNEOS vaccine. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old man with a past medical history of well-controlled HIV presented to the ED for 5 days of nocturnal diaphoresis, chills, intermittent arthralgia, and myalgia that began shortly after receiving the JYNNEOS vaccine. The patient reported an intermittent fever of 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) but denied cough, chest pain, and dyspnea, and had otherwise normal vital signs. Serum lab test results were significant for elevated leukocytosis of 13.4 and CRP of 7.0, but were otherwise normal. The patient reported complete resolution of his symptoms after a 14-day follow-up via phone call. CONCLUSIONS Mpox is unfortunately spreading across the globe; therefore, many treatments and vaccines are being studied to address the outbreak. The latest generation of vaccines employ an attenuated vaccinia virus and are separated into replicating and non-replicating categories, and while generally safer than previous variola vaccines, they still are associated with rare complications and adverse effects. Generally, vaccinia symptoms are mild and self-resolving. Treatment is largely supportive and most patients can be discharged following general serum lab work-up and cardiopulmonary assessment.",2023 Jun 11,20230611.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on vaccinia, not COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on vaccinia, not COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to the vaccinia vaccine and its effects, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the criteria for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to the vaccinia vaccine and its effects, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the criteria for scoring.",2,90,,
37103530,,Brooke-Spiegler syndrome: radiotherapy as the last resort?,Sweeney RA||Goebeler M||Flentje M||Klement RJ,"PURPOSE: To describe the case of successful radiotherapeutic treatment of a woman suffering from Brooke-Spiegler syndrome who had multiple disfiguring cylindromas on the entire scalp and further tumors on the trunk. METHODS: After decades of treatment with conventional therapies including surgery and topically applied salicylic acid, the 73-year-old woman agreed to undergo radiotherapeutic treatment. She received 60 Gy to the scalp and 36 Gy to painful nodules in the lumbar spine region. RESULTS: Over a follow-up period of 14 and 11 years, respectively, the scalp nodules almost completely regressed, while the lumbar nodules became painless and considerably smaller. Apart from alopecia, no late adverse effects of treatment remain. CONCLUSION: This case should remind us of the potential role that radiotherapy could play in treating Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. The required dose for treatment of such extensive disease is still a matter of debate due to the scarcity of radiotherapeutic experience.

38664389,PMC11045854,A report on neurogenic bladder in COVID-19 vaccine-associated acute transverse myelitis.,Zainudin MF||Hasim MR||Martin CE||Chandrabose T,"INTRODUCTION: Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare neurological complication of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. Various vaccines have been linked to ATM, such as non-replicating viral vectors, ribonucleic acid, and inactivated vaccines. An ATM case is presented here involving the BNT162b2 vaccine leading to asymmetrical incomplete paraplegia and neurogenic bladder. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old male developed urinary retention one day after his second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, followed by rapidly progressing lower limb weakness. Clinical examination showed asymmetrical paraparesis, reduced sensation below the T8 level, including perianal sensation, and loss of ankle and anal reflexes. Laboratory tests were largely unremarkable, while the spine MRI revealed thickened conus medullaris with a mild increase in T2/STIR signal intensity and subtle enhancement post gadolinium. Following treatment with methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and immunoglobulin, and a rehabilitation program, the patient achieved good motor and sensory recovery, but the bladder dysfunction persisted. Single-channel cystometry indicated neurogenic detrusor underactivity and reduced bladder sensation, as evidenced by low-pressure and compliant bladder. The urethral sphincter appeared intact or overactive. The post-void residual urine was significant, necessitating prolonged intermittent catheterisation. DISCUSSION: Bladder dysfunction due to the COVID-19 vaccine-associated ATM is not as commonly reported as motor or sensory deficits. To our knowledge, this is the first case to highlight a neurogenic bladder that necessitates prolonged intermittent catheterisation as a consequence of COVID-19 vaccine-associated ATM. This report highlights the rare complication of the neurogenic bladder resulting from the BNT162b2 vaccine. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term complications.",2024 Apr 25,20240425.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of neurogenic bladder as a complication of COVID-19 vaccination, thus meeting the specified criteria.', 'score': 1}","The article discusses a case of neurogenic bladder as a complication of COVID-19 vaccination, thus meeting the specified criteria.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a rare neurological complication (acute transverse myelitis) associated with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, specifically highlighting bladder dysfunction as an adverse effect, which aligns with the criteria of discussing complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a rare neurological complication (acute transverse myelitis) associated with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, specifically highlighting bladder dysfunction as an adverse effect, which aligns with the criteria of discussing complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",1,90,"{'complications': ['acute transverse myelitis', 'asymmetrical incomplete paraplegia', 'neurogenic bladder', 'urinary retention', 'lower limb weakness', 'neurogenic detrusor underactivity', 'reduced bladder sensation', 'significant post-void residual urine', 'necessitating prolonged intermittent catheterisation']}","['acute transverse myelitis', 'asymmetrical incomplete paraplegia', 'neurogenic bladder', 'urinary retention', 'lower limb weakness', 'neurogenic detrusor underactivity', 'reduced bladder sensation', 'significant post-void residual urine', 'necessitating prolonged intermittent catheterisation']"

The symptom resolved completely after treatment with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or an intraarticular steroid injection, however there have been few reports of long-term symptoms following coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. This case report describes a healthy, middle-aged, healthcare worker who developed post-vaccination subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis that lasted for more than 6 months after Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Japanese woman with no significant medical history was vaccinated in the standard site, with the needle direction perpendicular to the skin. Within a few hours after the second vaccination, severe shoulder pain and limited range of motion appeared. Although shoulder range of motion improved, her shoulder pain did not improved for several months, and she consulted an orthopedic doctor 5 months later. Radiographs of her left shoulder did not provide helpful diagnostic information. High intensity in the subacromial-subdeltoid space was seen on short TI inversion recovery of magnetic resonance imaging, showing subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis. She was diagnosed with a shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The patient was started on an oral anti-inflammatory drug, and the left subacromial space was injected with 2.5 mg of betamethasone with 3 ml of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine every 2 weeks. One month after starting this treatment, since her shoulder pain had not improved, the oral anti-inflammatory drug was switched to tramadol hydrochloride acetaminophen. However, 3 months after switching medication, the shoulder pain continued, and she worked so as to have minimal impact on her shoulder. CONCLUSION: A case of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis following a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine that lasted many months is reported. Injection technique is a modifiable risk factor, the adverse effects of which could potentially be mitigated with appropriate and relevant training of healthcare providers.

35490341,PMC9622426,A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings.,Ramsden SC||Pergjika A||Janssen AC||Mudahar S||Fawcett A||Walkup JT||Hoffmann JA,"OBJECTIVE: Agitation in children in acute care settings poses significant patient and staff safety concerns. While behavioral approaches are central to reducing agitation and oral medications are preferred, parenteral medications are used when necessary to promote safety. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an ultra-short-acting parenteral medication, droperidol, for the management of acute, severe agitation in children in acute care settings. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series/reports examined the effectiveness and safety of parenteral droperidol for management of acute agitation in patients </=21 years old in acute care settings. Effectiveness outcomes included time to sedation and need for a subsequent dose of medication. Safety outcomes were adverse effects such as QTc prolongation, hypotension, respiratory depression, and dystonic reactions. RESULTS: A total of 431 unique articles were identified. Six articles met inclusion criteria: two in the prehospital setting, one in the emergency department, and three in the inpatient hospital setting. The articles included a prospective observational study, three retrospective observational studies, and two case reports. The largest study reported a median time to sedation of 14 min (interquartile range 10-20 min); other studies reported a time to sedation of 15 min or less. Across studies, 8%-22% of patients required a second dose of medication for ongoing agitation. The most frequent adverse effects were dystonic reactions and transient hypotension. One patient had QTc prolongation and another developed respiratory depression, but both had significant comorbidities that may have contributed. The risk of bias in included studies ranged from moderate to critical.

34952451,,Lethal case of myocardial ischemia following overdose of the synthetic cannabinoid ADB-FUBINACA.,Simon G||Toth D||Heckmann V||Kuzma M||Mayer M,"The serious adverse effects of synthetic cannabinoids (SCB), the lack of human pharmacological data on SCBs, and the increasing number of SCBs with diverse structures are growing public health concerns. A fatal case of myocardial ischemia after ADB-FUBINACA overdose is reported. A 41-year-old male died after consuming a brown, powder-like drug. Autopsy revealed pallor in the left ventricle of the subendocardial two-third of the myocardium, and histological examination revealed early signs of myocardial ischemia: few wavy myocardial fibers, contraction band necrosis in the subendocardial region, and patchy subendocardial complement component 9 (C9) positivity. Toxicological analysis detected a high concentration of the indazole carboxamide derivative SCB ADB-FUBINACA (peripheral blood: 105 ng/mL) and a low concentration of the synthetic cathinone (SC) derivative stimulant N-ethylpentylone (NEP). The literature concerning ADB-FUBINCA overdoses is reviewed, and the possible mechanism of death and the cardiac effects of SCBs are discussed. Effects of SCBs are unpredictable, but they are potentially cardiotoxic, capable causing arrhythmias, cardiac hypertrophies, and myocardial ischemia. The cardiotoxicity of SCBs can be attributed to vasospasms, decreased myocardial contractility, and increased cardiac workload and oxygen demand. Based on the autopsy, histology, and toxicology, it could be reasonably suggested, that ADB-FUBINACA have been a significant contributor to the myocardial ischemia seen in histology. The mechanism of death was likely fatal arrhythmia induced by the patchy myocardial ischemia.

Linezolid is an oral oxazolidine used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Even though it has well-known adverse effects, purpuric cutaneous adverse drug reactions to linezolid have been scarcely described. This report is of a Puerto Rican man in his 80s who developed an extensive purpuric drug eruption secondary to linezolid use. Clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon, since prompt identification and discontinuation of the agent are essential for recovery. CASE REPORT An 89-year-old Puerto Rican man was given oral linezolid therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia and developed a widespread, purpuric cutaneous eruption 5 days into therapy. His condition prompted immediate discontinuation of the drug. Forty-eight hours after stopping the medication, he visited the Emergency Department. Abdominal punch biopsy revealed a superficial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with dermal eosinophils, a pathologic finding consistent with a purpuric drug eruption. This allowed for a timely diagnosis, exclusion of other mimickers, such as cutaneous vasculitis, and effective management. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous adverse drug reactions to linezolid have been scarcely reported in the literature. Due to the low incidence of this manifestation, the identification of the causative agent and accompanying treatment may be delayed. Mainstays in therapy are avoidance of the offending agent and treatment with corticosteroids, antihistamines, barrier ointments, and oral analgesics.

OBJECTIVES: Fulminant necrotising eosinophilic myocarditis triggered by a variety of drugs or vaccines is an extremely rare hypersensitivity reaction carrying a substantial mortality risk. Early recognition of this medical emergency may facilitate urgent hospital admission for investigation and treatment. Timely intervention can lead to complete cardiac recovery, but the non-specific clinical features and rarity make early diagnosis challenging. FINDINGS: The clinical and pathological observations from a case of fatal fulminant necrotising myocarditis in a 57-year-old woman, following the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, are described.

This case illustrates a clear temporal and possible causal relationship of COVID-19 vaccination with an ocular microvascular disorder, namely, retinal vein occlusion. PURPOSE: This study aimed to report a case of inferotemporal branch retinal vein occlusion after messenger RNA Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. CASE REPORT: A middle-aged woman developed right eye central scotoma 2 days after COVID-19 vaccination. She had transient hypertension during the first 2 days post-vaccination. A decrease in visual acuity (6/18) was documented. Initial retinal findings included flame-shaped hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots along inferotemporal branch retinal vessels. Optical coherence tomography revealed right eye cystoid macular edema. Laboratory investigation revealed mildly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable. She was treated for right eye inferotemporal branch retinal vein occlusion with cystoid macular edema and was given intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monthly in three doses. Her visual acuity improved to 6/6 with resolved cystoid macular edema. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates a clear temporal and possible causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and retinal vein occlusion. Post-vaccination transient hypertension or the immunological and inflammatory response to the vaccine may have contributed to the venous occlusive event in this case.

We report a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with adrenal insufficiency after initial vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with fever and an altered mental status 7 days after receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. The patient had a history of end-stage renal disease and epilepsy treated with valproate. He was diagnosed with NMS based on the clinical findings of hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, and an elevated creatine kinase level. Additionally, a reduction in the response of cortisol to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation was observed in the rapid ACTH stimulation test. The patient was treated with dantrolene, bromocriptine, and hydrocortisone, and he responded well to treatment. Dantrolene and bromocriptine were tapered off over 4 weeks. Hydrocortisone was also tapered, and the patient was discharged on oral hydrocortisone (30 mg). CONCLUSIONS The present case suggests a possible link between the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and NMS with adrenal insufficiency based on the temporal relationship between vaccine administration and disease onset, although the patient was taking valproate, a potential cause of NMS. Having a high level of suspicion is important because the diagnosis of NMS with adrenal insufficiency is often challenging due to non-specific clinical manifestations.

An 81-year-old male developed visual abnormality after the blood concentration of voriconazole was up to 6.47 mg/L induced by coadministration with esomeprazole. Voriconazole is a substrate of multiple CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP2C19 (the major route), CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is also converted to inactive metabolites through CYP3A4 and CYP2C19-mediated metabolism, and is also a CYP2C19 inhibitor. The coadministration with esomeprazole inhibited the metabolism of voriconazole via CYP2C19 and promoted the elevation of voriconazole blood concentration beyond the minimum toxic level (5.5 mg/L). According to the pharmacist's advice, the adverse effects of visual abnormalities in the patient disappeared after the clinician reduced voriconazole dosage by 50% when other medication schedules remained unchanged. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole should be considered in patients receiving PPIs, especially esomeprazole, in order to adjust the dosage in time and achieve optimal therapeutic response and minimal adverse reaction.",2023 Oct,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on drug interactions and visual abnormalities related to voriconazole.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on drug interactions and visual abnormalities related to voriconazole.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of visual abnormality induced by voriconazole and its interaction with esomeprazole, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of visual abnormality induced by voriconazole and its interaction with esomeprazole, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.",2,95,,

It primarily affects immunocompromised patients undergoing invasive procedures. Furthermore, the incidence, clinical features, and microbiological profile of this pathogen in the intensive care unit are rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION: We present four North African case studies of bacteremia in four young female patients admitted to the intensive care unit for ketoacidosis with a history of diabetes mellitus. All four patients developed catheter-related infections complicated by deep vein thrombosis. The catheter site was femoral in all cases, and the main clinical manifestation was poorly tolerated fever. The pathogen was isolated in multiple peripheral blood cultures (> 4) for each patient, showing a similar profile in all cases: resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and sensitivity to aminoglycosides, piperacillin, fluoroquinolones, and folate-pathway inhibitors. Targeted treatment consisted of a combination of ciprofloxacin 400 mg twice per day and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 400/80 mg thrice per day for all four cases. However, in one case, this regimen was switched to amikacin due to adverse effects. The outcomes were favorable in the majority of cases. The patients described in this study were 21, 66, 22, and 27-year-old North African women. CONCLUSION: Most of the reported cases shared common risk factors and clinical aspects.

Here, we report a case of new-onset hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (HMT) with the potential for progression to aplastic anemia (AA) that developed in a 46-year-old man 4 days after the fourth mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Platelet count rapidly decreased after vaccination and white blood cell count declined subsequently. Bone marrow examination immediately after disease onset showed severely hypocellular marrow (cellularity of almost 0%) in the absence of fibrosis, findings that were consistent with AA. Since the severity of pancytopenia did not meet the diagnostic criteria for AA, the patient was diagnosed with HMT that could progress to AA. Treatment with eltrombopag and cyclosporine was started immediately after diagnosis and cytopenia improved. Although it is difficult to determine whether the post-vaccination cytopenia was vaccine induced or accidental because the association was chronological, vaccination with an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine may be associated with development of HMT/AA.

Cephems containing an NMTT, a methyl-thiadiazol, and a thiadiazolethiol side chain are known to induce coagulation disorders. CASE REPORT A 76-year-old woman developed hypoprothrombinemia after receiving oral levofloxacin (LVFX) 250 mg q24h for 2 days followed by intravenous CMZ 2 g q8h for sigmoid diverticulitis. On day 5 of CMZ administration (after 12 doses in total), black stool was observed. On the following day (after 14 doses), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation was noted; PT and international normalized ratio (INR) were 37.1 s and 2.47, respectively. We diagnosed the patient with hypoprothrombinemia because of vitamin K deficiency caused by markedly elevated protein levels induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II on day 6 of CMZ administration. Intravenous vitamin K administration and CMZ cessation rapidly restored PT and led to the disappearance of black stool. CONCLUSIONS The causes of vitamin K deficiency were considered to be an impaired vitamin K cycle due to CMZ and decreased vitamin K intake because of malnutrition. These findings are consistent with CMZ's reported adverse effects. Decreased vitamin K production due to alterations in the gut bacterial flora by LVFX and CMZ was also postulated as a cause. If a bleeding tendency is noted during diverticulitis treatment with NMTT-containing cephems, switching to intravenous quinolones or carbapenems is recommended. It remains unclear how this reaction can be avoided; however, prudent monitoring of bleeding signs and PT-INR is recommended.",2022 Jul 27,20220727.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; it focuses on hypoprothrombinemia during cefmetazole treatment.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; it focuses on hypoprothrombinemia during cefmetazole treatment.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses hypoprothrombinemia as a complication of cefmetazole treatment, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses hypoprothrombinemia as a complication of cefmetazole treatment, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their adverse effects.",2,95,,

DESIGN: Illustrative video presentation. A case report is used to describe potential causes of an uteroperitoneal fistula found in a patient during evaluation of secondary infertility and to highlight surgical technique and management using the principles of fistula repair through a minimally invasive approach. The Institutional Review Board reviewed this video article and it was deemed ""not human subject research."" SETTING: Tertiary medical center. PATIENT(S): A 33-year-old G1P1001 woman with a history of a cesarean section presented with secondary infertility, pelvic pain, and dysmenorrhea and was found to have a posterior uteroperitoneal fistula at the time of hysterosalpingography. INTERVENTION(S): The patient underwent an uncomplicated robot-assisted laparoscopic excision of a posterior uteroperitoneal fistula with the use of careful dissection of the fistula tract, continuous reassessment, and tension-free closure in layers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Preoperative diagnosis and surgical management displaying intraoperative techniques for robot-assisted excision of fistula tract and repair of defect. RESULT(S): The patient underwent robot-assisted operative laparoscopy that revealed a 4-cm mass on the right posterior aspect of the uterus independent from her adnexa. Concomitant hysteroscopy revealed normal endometrium without an evident fistula. During chromopertubation, extravasation was seen into the peritoneal cavity from this mass. The mass and fistula tract were excised without a connection found from her cesarean scar, and reconstruction was performed in multiple layers. Endometriotic lesions were noted intraperitoneally in locations distant from the mass. The patient had significant improvement in her symptoms after surgery. CONCLUSION(S): We present a unique case of a suspected spontaneous posterior uteroperitoneal fistula in the presence of endometriosis without evidence of a connection to her prior hysterotomy scar. Possible etiologies include an undiagnosed, unrepaired hysterotomy extension or a result of chronic inflammation from deep infiltrating endometriosis. Adverse effects on fertility from uteroperitoneal fistulas may be due to disruption of sperm function or endometrial quality secondary to presence of old blood products sequestered in the fistula or due to resultant inflammation from the same. As in this video case, successful treatment of symptoms resulting from an uteroperitoneal fistula requires removal of the fistula tract.

Despite the lack of robust evidence for their use, C1 esterase inhibitors are recommended by guidelines for the treatment of refractory thrombolytic-associated OA. This report highlights the use of a C1 esterase inhibitor in a patient with tenecteplase-associated OA unresolved by antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy. SUMMARY: A 67-year-old white male with a history of hypertension managed with lisinopril presented to the emergency department with acute onset of slurred speech and left-sided hemiparesis. Following workup, an outside hospital's neurology stroke team suspected an acute infarct and determined the patient to be a candidate for tenecteplase. Approximately 1 hour after tenecteplase administration, the patient began complaining of dyspnea and mild oral angioedema. Immediate interventions for OA management included intravenous therapy with dexamethasone 10 mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg, and famotidine 20 mg. After an additional 30 minutes, the patient's OA symptoms continued to progress and a C1 esterase inhibitor (Berinert) was administered. Shortly after administration of the C1 esterase inhibitor, the patient's symptoms continued to worsen, ultimately leading to endotracheal intubation. Following intubation, symptom improvement was noted, and the patient was safely extubated after 30 hours. CONCLUSION: Although rare, OA is a potentially life-threatening complication of tenecteplase therapy and requires prompt pharmacological intervention to optimize patient outcomes.

33719653,,Ibrutinib-related uveitis: A report of two severe cases.,Bohn M||Bravo-Ljubetic L||Lee RWJ||Petrushkin H,"INTRODUCTION: Ibrutinib is a small-molecule drug approved for the treatment of haematological disorders and is known to be associated with visual disturbances, but uveitis has not yet been reported as an adverse effect of this medication. We present two cases of ibrutinib-associated severe uveitis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. CASE DESCRIPTION: Our first case is a 65-year-old woman who presented with acute onset of bilateral fibrinous anterior uveitis 1 day after starting ibrutinib. Her vision was hand movements in the right eye and 20/120 in the left with hyperaemic discs and subretinal fluid. Ibrutinib was stopped and she experienced a significant improvement under local and oral steroid treatment. The second case is a 64-year-old male with subacute onset of bilateral hypertensive anterior uveitis with pupillary seclusion and right eye hyphaema. He was on ibrutinib for the past 9 months. His vision at presentation was 20/80 and 20/60 for the right and left eye, respectively. He responded poorly to local steroid treatment until ibrutinib was stopped due to cardiac side-effects, after which his uveitis resolved and treatment was stopped. CONCLUSION: The temporal association between changes in ibrutinib treatment and our patients' ocular inflammation suggests a causative link. Ibrutinib increases Th1-based immune responses which is proposed as a mechanism for drug-induced uveitis. Its antiplatelet effect may explain the fibrinous nature of the inflammation and hyphaema.",2022 Jul,20210315.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on ibrutinib-related uveitis.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on ibrutinib-related uveitis.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses severe uveitis associated with the drug ibrutinib, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses severe uveitis associated with the drug ibrutinib, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.",2,95,,

34957792,,Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in pregnancy-a critical review of current evidence and guidelines.,Ng KXJ||Li KFC||Tan CK||Ong PJ,"Treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in women during pregnancy is challenging. Current standard treatment for ACS includes coronary angioplasty with guideline-directed medical therapy including aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which may portend adverse effects to the fetus. ACS increases ischemic and obstetric complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Management of these patients necessitates balancing the potential risks and benefits to both maternal and fetal health. We present a case of a 37-year-old female with a background of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented with Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The urine pregnancy test that was performed turned positive with an estimated gestational age of four weeks. After counselling on the potential risks and benefits, a diagnostic angiogram was performed which revealed triple vessel disease with critical stenosis in all three vessels. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed successfully with precautions taken to minimize radiation exposure to the fetus. In such cases, there is a fundamental trade-off between maternal and fetal health in the treatment of NSTEMI. Medications used for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome will need to be balanced against the potential risks to the fetus. Invasive coronary angiogram results in exposure to potentially teratogenic ionizing radiation and hence all efforts must be made to minimize exposure. Thus, risks and benefits of treatment ought to be discussed with patients and measures need to be taken to minimize potential harm to both the mother and fetus.",2021 Dec 22,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in pregnancy and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in pregnancy and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to acute coronary syndrome in pregnant women, specifically focusing on myocardial infarction, rather than complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to acute coronary syndrome in pregnant women, specifically focusing on myocardial infarction, rather than complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,
37501199,PMC10375727,Hypocalcemic tetany associated with simultaneous administration of cimetidine and nifedipine: a case report.,Bezabih YM||Bimrew MA||Bezabhe WM,"BACKGROUND: Acute hypocalcemia is generally caused by a sudden drop in serum calcium ion and presents with a mild or severe form of tetany. Even though the occurrence of hypocalcemia is well documented with certain drugs such as calcium chelators, bisphosphonates, and cisplatin, it is a very unusual and poorly documented adverse event with cimetidine and nifedipine. Here, we present a case of severe hypocalcemic tetany during simultaneous administration of cimetidine and nifedipine in a hypertensive patient with dyspepsia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old known human immunodeficiency virus patient from Ethiopia on antiretroviral therapy over the past 14 years presented to the emergency department with acute exacerbation of dyspepsia and hypertensive urgency. She was given intravenous cimetidine (400 mg) and oral nifedipine (30 mg) simultaneously. One hour after the administration of these two drugs, she developed severe hypocalcemic tetany with carpopedal spasm, involuntary plantar flexion, and muscle spasms. She also had severe retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath. Her blood pressure was 160/110 mmHg during the attack and she had no skin changes, such as urticaria. She was immediately given 1 g of calcium gluconate intravenously over 30 minutes. The carpopedal spasm progressively decreased during calcium gluconate administration. An hour later, she completely regained voluntary movement of her fingers and feet. The chest pain persisted, but resolved over the next 12 hours. The patient was discharged home after 2 days of observation. This is an unusual adverse effect that needs caution during concomitant administration of these drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypocalcemic tetany can occur with concomitant administration of cimetidine and nifedipine. Immediate treatment with calcium gluconate quickly reverses this adverse event. Concomitant administration of these drugs should be done with caution or be avoided if possible.",2023 Jul 28,20230728.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses an unusual adverse effect related to the simultaneous administration of two medications, cimetidine and nifedipine, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses an unusual adverse effect related to the simultaneous administration of two medications, cimetidine and nifedipine, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.",2,90,,

Yet, various inflammatory and autoimmune complications have been reported following vaccination. We aimed to report the case of a type 1 diabetic patient converting from Hashimoto's thyroiditis to Graves' disease after the fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine, thought to trigger an autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome). CASE PRESENTATION: A thirty-one-year-old female patient with type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis applied to our clinic with complaints of palpitations, anxiety, and weight loss one month after the fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine (2 doses of CoronaVac + 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech). She was receiving levothyroxine 50 mcg/day. When her thyroid function tests showed thyrotoxicosis, we initially considered thyroxine-related exogenous thyrotoxicosis. However, we considered Graves' disease upon persisting thyrotoxicosis despite thyroxine withdrawal, positive serum TSH receptor antibody titers, and other imaging findings. Therefore, various autoimmune and inflammatory events have been reported after the COVID-19 vaccination. Adjuvants in vaccines can trigger autoimmune events, which lead to ASIA syndrome. COVID-19 vaccines may cause increased TSH receptor antibody levels or change the balance in the activity of blocking and stimulating antibodies, which may cause a conversion from Hashimoto's to Graves' disease. CONCLUSION: This was the first case report where the patient experienced a conversion from Hashimoto's to Graves' disease after COVID-19 vaccination, which may ultimately be related to ASIA syndrome. Yet, more data is needed to elucidate such a relationship, and patients should closely be checked regularly after four doses of vaccination.",2023,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': ""The abstract explicitly discusses a case of Graves' disease developing after COVID-19 vaccination, representing a post-vaccination complication."", 'score': 1}","The abstract explicitly discusses a case of Graves' disease developing after COVID-19 vaccination, representing a post-vaccination complication.",1,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article discusses a case of autoimmune complications following COVID-19 vaccination, specifically the conversion from Hashimoto's thyroiditis to Graves' disease, which aligns with the criteria of discussing complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19."", 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of autoimmune complications following COVID-19 vaccination, specifically the conversion from Hashimoto's thyroiditis to Graves' disease, which aligns with the criteria of discussing complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",1,90,"{'complications': [""conversion from Hashimoto's thyroiditis to Graves' disease"", 'thyrotoxicosis', 'autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome)', 'increased TSH receptor antibody levels', 'change in the balance of blocking and stimulating antibodies']}","[""conversion from Hashimoto's thyroiditis to Graves' disease"", 'thyrotoxicosis', 'autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome)', 'increased TSH receptor antibody levels', 'change in the balance of blocking and stimulating antibodies']"

Acute episodes often involve the skin of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, and genitals, as well as internal areas of the body and respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa, which could be life-threatening. Histamine and bradykinin are the most recognized vasoactive mediators in the pathophysiology of angioedema. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a fibrinolytic that is commonly used for the treatment of cerebrovascular accidents. Angioedema is a rare adverse effect of tPA, with an estimated incidence of 0.02% in patients with myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism and 0.2% to 5.1% in patients with stroke. We report a unique case of tPA-associated angioedema with 24-h management. CASE REPORT A 79-year-old male patient presented to the Emergency Department with acute onset right-sided weakness, right-sided facial droop, and speech difficulties. Following the initial evaluation, it was determined that he was a candidate for receiving tPA therapy. On arrival at the Intensive Care Unit, he was noted to have right upper and then lower lip swelling. The patient was asymptomatic and did not show any signs concerning airway compromise. Treatment included systemic corticosteroids and antihistamines. The progression of the angioedema was further described with sequential images. The angioedema was completely resolved with treatment.

36004613,,Decompressive craniectomy for intracranial hypertension in vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia: a case series.,Eltayeb M||Jayakumar N||Coulter I||Johnson C||Crossman J,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines have been key in preventing COVID-19 infections and the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine has been widely used. However, increased rates of thromboembolic events were identified in recipients and, subsequently, a syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT) was described whereby recipients presented with venous sinus thromboses, haemorrhagic infarctions, and - consequently - raised intracranial pressure. National guidance recommended decompressive craniectomies for refractory intracranial hypertension. We describe our neurosurgical experience in managing a cohort of patients with VITT. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Four patients were included (three females and one male); median age was 46 years. All patients presented with a constellation of headache, focal neurological deficit(s), altered consciousness, and/or seizure at a median 11 d post-vaccine. Pre-operatively, median GCS was 7 and the median platelet count was 28 x 10(9)/L. Mean craniectomy size was 13 cm x 10 cm. All four cases tested positive for anti-PF4 antibodies. Median length of stay was 9 d (range: 2-25). Of the four who were operated upon, two survived to hospital discharge, and one of these subsequently died at a peripheral hospital. CONCLUSIONS: VITT-related sinus thromboses and associated infarcts are rare complications of the AZ vaccine. Neurosurgical management involves treating intracranial hypertension however survival outcomes in our cohort were poor. In our series, decompression was performed in deteriorating patients however prophylactic decompression, in the presence of extensive venous sinus thrombosis, should be considered on a case-by-case basis. As vaccination programmes accelerate across the world, neurosurgeons are likely to be increasingly involved in managing intracranial hypertension in patients with VITT-related sinus thromboses.",2024 Dec,20220825.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract explicitly discusses a rare complication (VITT) following the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, thus meeting the specified criteria.', 'score': 1}","The abstract explicitly discusses a rare complication (VITT) following the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, thus meeting the specified criteria.",1,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a specific complication (vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia) associated with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, detailing its clinical presentation and management, which aligns with the criteria of discussing complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 1, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a specific complication (vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia) associated with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, detailing its clinical presentation and management, which aligns with the criteria of discussing complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",1,90,"{'complications': ['venous sinus thromboses', 'haemorrhagic infarctions', 'raised intracranial pressure', 'intracranial hypertension', 'poor survival outcomes']}","['venous sinus thromboses', 'haemorrhagic infarctions', 'raised intracranial pressure', 'intracranial hypertension', 'poor survival outcomes']"

However, these drugs are associated with several new side effects that need early detection. We present the case of a 41-year-old male patient who has been diagnosed with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with metastatic retroperitoneal lymph nodes and a subdiaphragmatic metastatic lesion, undergoing second-line treatment with a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. After completing four cycles, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent fever and profuse sweating. A CT scan showed multiple pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in several locations, raising suspicion of disease progression. The patient's clinical progress was favorable after symptomatic treatment (antipyretics) and was discharged one week after admission. Several days later, the patient complained about painful bilateral ocular redness and was diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis. Further blood tests showed elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels of 67 U/L (normal range: 8 - 52) and decreasing alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels of 698 ng/mL (previously 1210 ng/mL), indicative of non-progression of the oncological disease. Finally, an excisional biopsy confirmed the presence of non-necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, leading to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis-like reaction (SLR) induced by immunotherapy as the etiology of the polyadenopathy syndrome.

Propylthiouracil, a member of thiouracils group, is widely used in medical treatment of hyperthyroidism. Propylthiouracil is associated with multiple adverse effects such as rash, agranulocytosis hepatitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, but rarely triggers DRESS/DiHS syndrome. Here, we describe a severe case of propylthiouracil-induced DRESS/DiHS syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old female was treated with methimazole for hyperthyroidism at first. 4 weeks later, the patient developed elevated liver transaminase so methimazole was stopped. After liver function improved in 2 weeks, medication was switched to propylthiouracil therapy. The patient subsequently developed nausea and rash followed by a high fever, acute toxic hepatitis and multiple organ dysfunction (liver, lung and heart), which lasted for 1 month after propylthiouracil was started. According to the diagnostic criteria, the patient was diagnosed of DRESS/DiHS syndrome which was induced by propylthiouracil. As a result, propylthiouracil was immediately withdrawn. And patient was then treated with adalimumab, systematic corticosteroids and plasmapheresis in sequence. Symptoms were finally resolved 4 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: Propylthiouracil is a rare cause of the DRESS/DiHS syndrome, which typically consists of severe dermatitis and various degrees of internal organ involvement. We want to emphasize through this severe case that DRESS/DiHS syndrome should be promptly recognized to hasten recovery.",2023 Jan 23,20230123.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of DRESS/DiHS syndrome induced by propylthiouracil, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of DRESS/DiHS syndrome induced by propylthiouracil, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,
39459421,PMC11509409,A Potential Pneumothorax Induced by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Case Report and Literature Review.,Shin YE||Kim H||Yoo JJ||Kim SG||Kim YS,"Background and Objectives: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which target immune checkpoints in cancer cells, are increasingly used as a mainstay in anticancer treatment. The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is also a first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events (IrAEs) which range from mild to severe, potentially leading to the need for discontinuing immunotherapy. We report a case of a pneumothorax, a rare side effect caused by IrAEs. Materials and Methods: This paper reports a case of a 78-year-old male HCC patient who developed a recurrent pneumothorax, suspected to be an adverse effect of ICIs. Results: The patient was a current smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history. Prior to initiating ICIs, a chest CT scan showed mild emphysema and fibrosis attributable to smoking. Following ICI treatment, the patient developed a recurrent pneumothorax. Further tests revealed no underlying cause for the pneumothorax other than the ICIs and smoking, and there were no signs of intrapulmonary metastasis or pneumonitis. Conclusions: When a pneumothorax occurs in a patient undergoing immunotherapy, it is important to consider it as a potential adverse effect of the treatment. Special attention should be given to the possibility that immunotherapy may exacerbate underlying lung conditions. Patients should be advised on the importance of smoking cessation. As there are currently no guidelines for resuming immunotherapy after a pneumothorax, it is crucial to weigh the risks and benefits and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of the medication.",2024 Oct 6,20241006.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of pneumothorax as an adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and does not meet the criteria for discussing complications of COVID-19 vaccines.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of pneumothorax as an adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and does not meet the criteria for discussing complications of COVID-19 vaccines.",2,95,,

Among the different vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2, Covishield was the first vaccine approved for emergency use in Nepal. We report two cases of Superficial Vein Thrombosis (SVT) for the first time in the literature after vaccination with the Chimpanzee Adenovirus-vectored Vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine). CASES PRESENTATION: Two cases, a 24-year-old young Chhetri male and a 62-year-old Chhetri female who have received Covishield (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine, developed pain in left calf after 2 weeks and 10 weeks of vaccination, respectively. Both the case belongs to the Chhetri ethnic group of Nepal. The pain became severe on the fourth week of immunization in the first case while the pain was acute and severe on the 10(th) week of vaccination in the second case. The first presented to emergency room and second case was referred to the emergency room from Orthopedic Clinic. On evaluation the first patient had normal vitals with no history of fever and swelling yet displayed non-radiating mild to moderate intensity pain localized to left leg below the knee which became aggravated by movements. In the second case however pain was more intense with other characteristics as first case. Both cases had low wells score (< 4). On local examination tenderness was noted on squeezing but other systemic examination findings of the patient were within normal limits in both cases. Among the numerous vaccines used to fight the battle against COVID-19 disease, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, Covishield, has been widely used in Nepal and India. Apart from other minor side effects, in few cases thromboses have been reported after vaccination of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Covishield, vaccine. CONCLUSION: These cases reporting Superficial Vein Thrombosis may be an additional adverse effect to the list of adverse events associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Covishield, vaccine.

Several case reports have shown that vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implantation can help treat central idiopathic intractable hiccups. However, we present a contrary case of a patient who developed intractable singultus following VNS placement for medically refractory epilepsy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 71-year-old male patient with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent VNS implantation and developed intractable hiccups shortly thereafter. The hiccups were severe and persistent, such that the patient developed a Mallory-Weiss tear, which required intensive care, invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation, and a prolonged rehabilitation course. Despite multiple therapies including phrenic nerve block and Nissen fundoplication, the patient's hiccups persisted and only stopped once the VNS was permanently deactivated. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the incidence of hiccups after VNS implantation. We present one case of hiccups as a direct consequence of VNS implantation. The clinical impact of this report is significant given the relative unfamiliarity of hiccups as an adverse effect of VNS implantation.

We present the case of a 28-year-old male diagnosed with stage IV non-BRAFV600E mutated melanoma in 2014. After the surgery and the failure of ipilimumab and IL-2, he started immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. One month after the start of the therapy, he came to our department showing a severe flare of plaque psoriasis with a body surface area of 40% and a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 28. Given the severity of the clinical picture and the contraindications to conventional systemic therapy, we decided to start biological treatment with risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 inhibitor. After just the induction phase, he showed almost skin clearance obtaining a reduction of more than 90% of the baseline PASI.

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 38-year-old female with a history of myopia and previous episodes of PIC and iCNVM presented with distorted vision in her right eye, seven days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The patient exhibited active PIC lesions with iCNVM confirmed on multimodal imaging. Treatment with a combination of oral corticosteroids and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection led to disease resolution. Subsequent COVID-19 vaccinations, administered while the patient was immunosuppressed, did not lead to disease relapse. However, relapse occurred following the fourth COVID-19 vaccine, when the patient was not immune suppressed.

Vaccines contain adjuvants which are not exempt from adverse effects and can trigger the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). There is very little information about autoimmune endocrine disease and the ASIA after the use of mRNA-based SARS-CoV2 vaccination. CASE SERIES: We report three cases and also review the literature showing that the thyroid gland can be involved in the ASIA induced by the mRNA-based SARS-CoV2 vaccination. We present the first case to date of silent thyroiditis described in the context of SARS-CoV2 vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech. Also, we discuss the first subacute thyroiditis in the context of SARS-CoV2 vaccination with the Moderna's vaccine. Finally, we provide another case to be added to existing evidence on Graves' disease occurring post-vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. DISCUSSION: Adjuvants play an important role in vaccines. Their ability to increase the immunogenicity of the active ingredient is necessary to achieve the desired immune response. Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines use mRNA coding for the SARS-CoV2 S protein enhanced by adjuvants. In addition, the cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV2 and thyroid antigens has been reported. This would explain, at least, some of the autoimmune/inflammatory reactions produced during and after SARS-CoV2 infection and vaccination.

Immunocompromised patients are particularly vulnerable to dysbiosis not only by virtue of a defect in the immune system but also due to increased susceptibility to infection and multiple courses of antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation is by far the most effective option for restoring gastrointestinal homeostasis. However, it is contraindicated in patients with significant primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. This article presents the case of a 59-year-old patient with common variable immunodeficiency, after splenectomy at age 39 for primary immune thrombocytopenia, who manifested diarrhea of up to 10 stools per day accompanied by secondary malnutrition and cachexia. The patient was admitted to the hospital on multiple occasions due to this condition, with stool PCR tests confirming a HHV-5 (Cytomegalovirus, CMV) infection. Following the administration of valganciclovir, the patient's complaints diminished, although, upon cessation of the drug, the symptoms recurred. In addition, the patient had an intestinal infection with C. difficile etiology.

However, also autonomic nervous system can be involved with heart rate fluctuations, blood pressure instability, pupillary dysfunction, and urinary retention. Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, GBS has been reported among neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although etiopathological mechanisms still have to be clearly defined. We report the case of a 79-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, who was affected by SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia and developed dysautonomic symptoms after 10 days of hospitalization. A neurological evaluation was performed, and GBS was considered as a possible cause of the clinical manifestations.

There are case reports of solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy presenting with mild hypercalcemia, leading to a diagnosis of PJP. Recent studies have shown efficacy of PJP prophylaxis for patients treated with rituximab with a favourable adverse effect profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old male with a history of PR3-ANCA vasculitis, chronic kidney disease and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction presented to our tertiary care hospital with a two-week history of confusion and non-productive cough. Background immunosuppression with rituximab was completed every six months. The patient was found to have hypercalcemia and new infiltrates and ground glass opacities on cross-sectional imaging. Bronchoscopy was performed that was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii. He was treated with 21 days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and prednisone with resolution of symptoms and hypercalcemia. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we present a novel case of PJP in a non-transplant recipient preceded by hypercalcemia.

It is important to use protective equipment during treatment. In previous cases, complications such as conjunctival hyperemia, anterior uveitis, and choroidal neovascularization were reported. We report a case who developed chorioretinal anastomosis secondary to inadvertent alexandrite laser exposure. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44 year-old woman presented with decrease of vision in the left eye. She had an history of alexandrite laser treatment for facial hair removal two weeks ago. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed an elevated yellowish lesion in the temporal macula and retina pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy was observed in the inferotemporal perifoveal region. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the left eye revealed the disorganization of inner and outer retinal layers, a rupture in the Bruch membrane, and an absence of RPE. Fluorescein angiography images showed early hyperfluoresence inferior to the fovea. OCT angiography revealed an abnormal vascular network between deep retina layers and choroid. B-scan with flow overlay demonstrated the blood flow in the abnormal vascular network which is suggestive of chorioretinal anastomosis. The patient was followed monthly for choroidal neovascularization development. Six months after laser exposure the best corrected visual acuity was partially improved in the left eye and fundus examination showed pigmentary changes. CONCLUSION: Chorioretinal anastomosis may rarely develop secondary to inadvertent alexandrite laser treatment.

Shortly after, computed tomography showed a basal ganglia hemorrhage. After many weeks of rehabilitation, some cognitive deficits remained. DISCUSSION: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate supplements. The sexual enhancement supplement ingested had monoamine oxidase inhibitor properties and precipitated a hypertensive emergency with an intracerebral hemorrhage. Reducing medication dosage, switching medication, using drug holidays, and changing the time of administration may help alleviate sexual side effects.

36085030,PMC9463762,Lithium-induced nephropathy; One medication with multiple side effects: a case report.,Zhang P||Gandhi H||Kassis N,"BACKGROUND: Lithium carbonate is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A spectrum of side effects is associated with lithium, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis, chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and minimal change disease. Although the former three adverse effects are well-known, minimal change disease is relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a case of lithium therapy-induced minimal change disease with concurrent chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy. A 66-year old man with bipolar disorder treated by lithium for 20 years, presented to the hospital with anasarca and decreased urine output for 4 weeks. The medical history also included hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Further laboratory investigation revealed elevated serum lithium (2.17 mmol/L), potassium (6.0 mmol/L), and creatinine levels (2.92 mg/dL), nephrotic range proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia. Lithium was discontinued and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids. He underwent a kidney biopsy, which showed findings consistent with minimal change disease with concurrent acute tubular injury and chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy. The patient was subsequently treated with steroids in an outpatient setting. He did not respond to the treatment, and hemodialysis was started. CONCLUSION: Based on the previously reported cases and review of literature, occurrence of lithium-associated minimal change nephropathy is rare. Patients with lithium-associated minimal change disease and acute tubular injury usually respond to discontinuation of lithium therapy and/or steroid treatment. In this case, minimal change nephropathy was steroid-resistant and kidney function of the patient reported here did not recover after 6-month follow-up. We postulated the underlying cause to be minimal change disease with chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy due to long-term lithium use. This case provides an example of a rare side effect of lithium-induced minimal change nephropathy with chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy in addition to its well-known complication of interstitial nephritis or diabetes insipidus. In our opinion, these patients likely have much worse clinical outcome.",2022 Sep 9,20220909.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on lithium-induced nephropathy, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on lithium-induced nephropathy, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to lithium therapy, specifically lithium-induced nephropathy, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to lithium therapy, specifically lithium-induced nephropathy, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,
37916376,,PENG block associated with dexmedetomidine sedation for intramedullary femoral fixation in high-risk elderly patients: a case series and review of the literature.,Vergari A||Console E||Nestorini R||Frassanito L||Piersanti A||Sbaraglia F||Della Sala F||De Padova D||Ferrone G||Rossi M,"BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a major cause of hospitalization among the elderly population. The standard surgical treatment involves early repair to reduce mortality and morbidity. One type of treatment in the case of intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures is intramedullary nailing, as it decreases soft tissue damage and permits early weight bearing. The most common anesthesia technique combines spinal anesthesia with a peripheral block. In cases where spinal anesthesia is contraindicated, general anesthesia is preferred. However, both techniques can lead to significant complications, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities. Pain management after hip surgery, particularly in elderly and frail individuals, poses a challenge. The pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) targets the innervation of the anterior portion of the hip joint and is increasingly used for pain management related to hip surgery. CASE SERIES: This paper presents a case series of three elderly patients who underwent pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) block combined with dexmedetomidine sedation for intramedullary femoral fixation. CONCLUSIONS: The PENG block can be effectively used as the sole anesthetic technique for managing elderly patients undergoing intramedullary femoral fixation while on antiplatelet drugs. This procedure effectively controlled pain during both the surgical and postoperative periods. The addition of dexmedetomidine for sedation enables comfortable and safe procedures, minimizing the risk of perioperative neurocognitive dysfunctions and without adverse effects on cardiorespiratory function.",2023 Oct,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of a PENG block for anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing femoral fixation, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of a PENG block for anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing femoral fixation, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Currently, most exosome products are available for topical administration, and the use of subdermal injection as a route of administration has not been approved. AIMS: The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of skin necrosis that occurred following an intradermal injection of lyophilized exosomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We hereby report a case of a middle-aged man who experienced adverse effects after receiving an intradermal injection of lyophilized exosomes. Multiple injections of an exosome product were administered to treat enlarged facial pores. Shortly after the injection, the patient felt pain and noticed several dark red bumps. Three days after injection, the lesions transformed into palpable, painful, non-blanchable purplish papules and nodules, accompanied by central, tiny crusted erosions. The residual product was injected into the upper arm using an intradermal method. Similar lesions also appeared, and a skin biopsy showed necrotic keratinocytes, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and eccrine necrosis. RESULTS: There are few reports available regarding complications, especially those related to intradermal exosomes. These complications include multiple foreign-body granulomatous reactions at the injection sites. In our case, oral prednisolone was administered for a duration of 7 days. After the treatment, the lesions exhibited notable improvement, eventually leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

However, pharmacokinetic information on the transfer of trazodone and its active metabolite, 1-m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), across the placenta or into breast milk is limited. In this study, we describe the pharmacokinetic profile of trazodone and mCPP concentrations in maternal and neonatal blood and breast milk. Case Presentation: A 44-year-old female received oral trazodone 50 mg once daily during pregnancy (28-38 gestational weeks) and lactation, along with etizolam for anxiety disorder with depressive syndrome. A male infant weighing 2,918 g was born at 38 weeks of gestation. Because of persistent respiratory disturbance, oxygenation was initiated immediately after birth, and the infant was admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit for 5 days. No pulmonary dysfunction or birth defects were detected, and no medication and circulatory support were needed during admission. Trazodone and mCPP concentrations in cord blood at 7.4 hours after maternal dosing were 267.6 and 22.8 ng/mL, respectively, which were comparable with maternal serum levels. The trazodone and mCPP concentrations in breast milk collected 7.2 hours after maternal dosing were 50.2 and 3.2 ng/mL, respectively. The infant developed normally, with no drug-related adverse effects at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month postpartum checkups. Conclusion: Trazodone and its active metabolite were transferred into placenta and breast milk. However, their effects in utero could not be clarified.

They are generally avoided in elderly patients age greater than 65 or in patients with a history of CAD. Although there are reported cases of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) or Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) in patients after ingesting therapeutic doses of triptan or dihydroergotamine, this is the first case report, up to our knowledge, of a patient, who had no previous cardiac history, that was diagnosed with both ACS and TGA. A 59-year-old woman with a long-standing history of migraine, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of amnesia, chest pain, and left arm numbness after ingesting a single dose of oral sumatriptan approximately 1-2 h prior to arrival. She had no recollection of the events that occurred after taking sumatriptan. No acute laboratory abnormalities were found except for an elevated troponin, which continued to trend upwards. Her EKG had no ST-T wave abnormalities. She was diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), non-ST elevation MI. She had a negative noncontrast CT head. Neurology was consulted for her amnesia and diagnosed her with Transient Global Amnesia (TGA). They recommended discontinuing sumatriptan and beginning topiramate as a prophylactic therapy. There is an increasing number of reports delineating sumatriptan's adverse effects. Emergency medicine physicians should promptly recognize the toxic effects and adverse reactions from triptans.

CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man with a history of catatonia, refractory epilepsy and functional impairment, required frequent changes in his anticonvulsant and antipsychotic treatment, due to adverse effects. During 2019, in the month of July, clozapine was changed to amisulpride, in September he developed fever, muscle stiffness, stupor, diaphoresis and tachypnea over a two-week period; paraclinical tests showed elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and leukocytosis, so NMS was considered. The antipsychotic was withdrawn and he was treated with bromocriptine and biperiden, with a good response. Ten days after discharge, he began treatment with olanzapine, which generated a similar episode to the one described in December, with subsequent management and resolution. DISCUSSION: The diagnosis is based on the use of drugs that alter dopamine levels, plus altered state of consciousness, fever, autonomic instability and paraclinical tests showing leukocytosis and elevated CPK. Differential diagnoses must be ruled out. Early diagnosis generally leads to total remission, although some patients will suffer complications, long-term sequelae or recurrences. The recurrence in this case derived from the early reintroduction of the neuroleptic after the first episode. Treatment should be individualised according to severity to avoid mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical antipsychotics are rarely suspected of generating NMS. Moreover, the time to reintroduction after an episode must also be taken into account.",2023 Jan-Mar,20230406.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with atypical antipsychotics.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with atypical antipsychotics.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with atypical antipsychotics, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with atypical antipsychotics, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Recent advances in minimally invasive surgery may play an important role in decreasing the adverse effects and complications of lymph node dissections. We present our technique utilizing a single-port (SP) robot assisted laparoscopic bilateral ILND in a patient with pT3N2Mx penile cancer s/p partial penectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. METHODS: We present a case of a 64-year-old man who underwent a radical penectomy for previously diagnosed penile cancer. Pathology report showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. In accordance with NCCN guidelines, we performed a bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymph node dissection using robotic assisted SP laparoscopy with the DaVinci Single-Site platform. Our methods are detailed in this technical report. RESULTS: Total operative time was 3 hours and 38 minutes in duration with minimal blood loss (<20 mL). A 3 cm inguinal lymph node was excised and positive for malignancy without involvement of other nodes. The patient was discharged 90 minutes after recovery in PACU without narcotics and returned to normal bowel function within 6 hours. CONCLUSION: We present a successful surgical outcome of a SP robotic ILND in treating a patient with T3N2M0 penile cancer. At the time of publication, the patient is cancer-free with no palpable lymphadenopathy on exam.

Muscle-related adverse effects of statins have been very challenging in clinical practice and they necessitate high clinical suspicion. This case report highlights how statin-induced autoimmune myopathy often goes undiagnosed. CASE REPORT We present a 69-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease who presented with myalgia and progressive proximal muscle weakness for 2 months, with a creatinine kinase of 8323 U/L. Atorvastatin was held on admission and the patient received intravenous (IV) fluid as treatment for presumed rhabdomyolysis. Although CK was trending down, he did not show significant improvement in muscle weakness or myalgia. At this point, myositis was suspected, so a myositis panel including anti-HMG Co-A reductase antibody was ordered and he was started on IV steroids. Anti-HMG Co-A reductase antibody was positive, and the rest of myopathy workup was negative. Meanwhile, the patient's muscle weakness significantly improved with IV steroid. He was discharged on methylprednisolone with close outpatient rheumatology follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Muscle-related adverse effects of statins, including rhabdomyolysis and myopathy, can fail to respond to conservative management. It is crucial to identify and manage statin-induced autoimmune myopathy as a possible differential diagnosis in patients with muscle weakness and elevated CK while on statin therapy who do not respond to intravenous fluid alone.",2024 Sep 2,20240902.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses statin-induced autoimmune myopathy and its complications, which is unrelated to the complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses statin-induced autoimmune myopathy and its complications, which is unrelated to the complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

Adverse effects with the combination therapy may be more severe than the ones seen with single immune checkpoint inhibitors. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a unique case of a 59-year-old man of dark skin complexion who underwent treatment with intravenous ipilimumab-nivolumab every 3 weeks for metastatic malignant melanoma. After three cycles of this therapy, he developed extensive skin depigmentation that within 6 weeks, affected nearly the entire skin surface, along with progressive poliosis. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Ipilimumab-nivolumab therapy was subsequently discontinued due to grade 3 enterocolitis requiring high-dose steroids and intravenous infliximab. About six months later, imaging studies showed a relapse of malignant melanoma. At that juncture, vitiligo affected the total body surface area, resembling albinism, along with near-total poliosis and significant photosensitivity. Pembrolizumab was tried but had to be stopped after three cycles due to the reoccurrence of grade 3 enterocolitis. Progression of malignant melanoma with new brain, lung, liver, subcutaneous, and colonic metastases led to the patient's demise.

The most common associated adverse effects of TKI include thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Facial edema is a rare adverse reaction that may cause significant psychological burden. Treatment is life-long in many cases therefore it is vital to have options available to manage these adverse effects. CASE REPORT: We present a 70-year-old female with a medical history of CML, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented to our dermatology clinic for chief complaint of worsening edematous facial rash beginning after initiation of dasatinib. We were able to achieve significant improvement with a regimen that allowed her to remain on dasatinib. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: We treated the patient with a novel, unreported regimen of topical metronidazole 1% gel to be applied every morning and topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment to be applied twice daily. She had significant improvement with the treatment and was continued on this topical regimen indefinitely. DISCUSSION: Previous reports of treatment options available for TKI-associated facial edema include topical and systemic corticosteroids, which can cause long-term side effects int the context of long-term TKI use.

During the adjuvant chemotherapy, computed tomography (CT) revealed recurrence sites in the liver and para-aortic lymph nodes. Therefore, chemotherapy was initiated. After first-line (capecitabine with oxaliplatin) and second-line (paclitaxel with ramucirumab) treatments, nivolumab was used as third-line chemotherapy. This treatment showed a strong effect against the tumor. However, following an immune-related adverse effect (irAE) because of nivolumab, the therapy was halted. The irAE was diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency that was controllable by oral intake of steroids. CPT-11 was started and showed a similarly strong effect to that observed for nivolumab. Eventually, the recurrent tumor lesions became too small to be detected by CT. We discontinued CPT-11 at the request of the patient. Even after discontinuation, no recurrent sites have been observed, allowing us to declare a case of clinical complete response (cCR).

37856779,,The treatment challenge of heterotopic ossification in a patient with Parkinson's disease and stroke.,Ata AM||Kesikburun B||Baskan B||Alemdaroglu E,"OBJECTIVE: Neurogenic heterotopic ossification (HO) is characterized by bone formation in a non-anatomical site. It is usually seen in patients with spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. It occurs less frequently in other types of acquired brain injury. Neurogenic HO has only been recorded in a few cases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Its treatment is challenging and may need pain palliation methods. The course and treatment approach of a complicated case with PD and stroke who developed HO of the hip joints during rehabilitation was discussed in this article. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old male patient with stroke and PD experienced restriction and pain in both hip joints. Bilateral HO was discovered on a pelvic radiograph. He did not benefit from exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or indomethacin. Radiotherapy has also been tried to treat HO.

36748760,PMC9909063,A Rare Case Presentation of Vitiligo Associated With Atezolizumab.,Nwanwene K||Abdallah M||Pacioles T,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors target the T-cell deactivation system via the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). As a result, the activated T-cell enhances the host tumor response. However, even with their essential clinical benefits, ICIs are associated with a broad spectrum of adverse effects that can be generalized or tissue-specific inflammatory responses known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The most common dermatologic toxicity manifests mainly as maculopapular rash and pruritus. Understanding the complexity of immune-mediated response and the importance of clinical histopathologic correlation in recognizing irAEs allows for appropriate intervention and patient care due. We present the case of a 71-year-old African American male diagnosed with a large-cell poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the gastroesophageal junction of the stomach with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He was treated with carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab for 4 cycles. However, he developed vitiligo while on maintenance atezolizumab, which is rarely seen with atezolizumab use.

We encountered a case of cholinergic crisis caused by distigmine bromide, which resulted in a rapid decrease in serum ChE levels, hypothermia, respiratory failure, and circulatory failure within a short period of time. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old man was admitted to a psychiatric hospital to treat behavioral disorders due to irritability and violent behavior. The patient was referred to our hospital for septic shock secondary to urinary tract infection and respiratory failure. He had not defecated for 5 days before visiting our hospital. He had moderate intellectual disability. Immediately after admission, he developed hand tremors and drooling. The airway was obstructed by drooling due to vomiting of yellow clear gastric juice. DIAGNOSIS: The patient's high saliva volume, bradycardia, respiratory failure (54 breaths/min), constricted pupils (2.5/mm), poor oxygenation, and a history of oral medication were consistent with the diagnosis of cholinergic crisis due to distigmine bromide. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, the patient was immediately intubated. He was treated with noradrenaline (0.1 microg/kg/min) to increase his blood pressure. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Since he had circulatory failure, vasopressin (approximately 1 U/h) was administered. Continuous intravenous atropine sulfate (0.6 mg/h) was also administered for high saliva volume. OUTCOMES: On the 8th ICU day, the patient's drooling and bradycardia improved. The patient was physically and mentally stable, and transferred to the referring hospital.

It is infrequently associated with hematologic adverse effects, ranging from isolated thrombocytopenia or neutropenia to pancytopenia. Although the mechanism is poorly understood, it is considered an immune-mediated phenomenon. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use presented having 2 months of lower back pain associated with new acute lower-extremity weakness, numbness, paresthesia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed L5-S1 osteomyelitis with an epidural phlegmon, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin, was initiated. On day 33 of treatment, the patient was noted to have developed neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and eosinophilia. Vancomycin was the suspected cause and was replaced with daptomycin; laboratory tests for alternative causes of the bicytopenia were negative. Resolution of the bicytopenia occurred 5 days after vancomycin was stopped, and the eosinophilia continued to improve. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score was 6, deeming vancomycin as the ""probable"" cause. CONCLUSIONS Routine blood analysis during long-term vancomycin therapy is crucial to identifying hematologic suppression early. Prompt discontinuation of vancomycin is key to the management of the condition, with some case reports advocating for filgrastim adjuvant therapy to accelerate recovery. Cases of recurrence of the cytopenia with reexposure to vancomycin have been documented, and therefore inquiry into prior adverse reactions to vancomycin is recommended. Given the widespread use of vancomycin and the potential risks of bleeding and infection associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, respectively, we caution physicians to be aware of this rare adverse effect in patients on long-term vancomycin therapy.",2021 Jun 8,20210608.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses hematologic adverse effects associated with vancomycin therapy, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses hematologic adverse effects associated with vancomycin therapy, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

The drug had an influence on the inhibition of clinical and radiological activity of the disease. Despite the control of the underlying disease, skin cancers occurred during treatment. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were diagnosed at an early stage when complete resection was possible and negative (R0) margin resection was achieved. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Dermatological examination should be performed at the beginning and during treatment with fingolimod. Patients need to be informed about the risk of malignancy. Patient education are crucial during treatment, which allows achieving a good therapeutic effect, thus minimizing the risk of malignancy and enabling its early detection and cure.",2022,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on fingolimod treatment for multiple sclerosis and its association with skin cancer.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on fingolimod treatment for multiple sclerosis and its association with skin cancer.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to fingolimod treatment in multiple sclerosis, specifically the occurrence of skin cancers, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to fingolimod treatment in multiple sclerosis, specifically the occurrence of skin cancers, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

Post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) is a very rare but serious adverse effect following the application of an olanzapine in a long-acting form. The most common symptoms of the syndrome are sedation, delirium, dysarthria, ataxia, extrapyramidal symptoms, agitation, dizziness, or seizure. The predispositions, prevention, and exact mechanism of PDSS remain unclear. CASE REPORT We present a case report of a 30-year-old male patient experiencing PDSS, including the main symptoms of PDSS, diagnostic methods, olanzapine plasma concentrations, therapeutic process, and outcome. We then include a follow-up of the patient 2.5 years later. The patient did not have any long-term damage, had no disabilities, and no post-traumatic stress disorder following the event. We include information about his current medications, further use of LAI antipsychotics, and update about his everyday life. CONCLUSIONS PDSS is a life-threatening condition clinicians must be aware of, and the easiest precaution is a 3-h observation after the application of an injection. Because the predispositions, prevention, and exact mechanism of PDSS remains unclear, it is very important to report the rare cases of PDSS and conduct further research for the safety of our patients. The follow-up of the patient showed that the patient is doing well, he has no post-traumatic stress disorder following the event, and he did continue to use LAI antipsychotic medication.",2022 Oct 17,20221017.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on a rare adverse effect of an antipsychotic injection, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on a rare adverse effect of an antipsychotic injection, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome related to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, which is not related to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome related to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, which is not related to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.",2,90,,

Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) is an herbaceous shrub found throughout the world that has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old woman with obesity and GERD presented to a primary care clinic with new-onset galactorrhea. A urine pregnancy test was negative. Prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and a metabolic panel were all within normal limits. A mammogram demonstrated scattered areas of fibroglandular density and benign-appearing calcifications in the left breast. The breast ultrasound showed no suspicious findings. Her medications included intermittent Echinacea, etonogestrel implant 68 mg subdermal, and the supplement stinging nettle 500 mg, which she had been taking over the past month for environmental allergies. After consultation with a clinical pharmacist, the stinging nettle was discontinued. No additional changes to her medications or supplements were made. One week after discontinuation, she returned to the clinic with complete resolution of the galactorrhea. CONCLUSIONS Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) is a common supplement and has effects on (1) sex hormone-binding globulin, (2) histamine-induced prolactin release, and (3) serotonin-induced release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. The local estrogen bioactivity in breast tissue may subsequently lead to gynecomastia and/or galactorrhea.

Secukinumab, an interleukin-17A (IL-17A) inhibitor, is used to treat patients with moderate-to-severe plaques associated with psoriatic arthritis. The aim of this case report was to highlight the efficacy of secukinumab treatment in a patient with both psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis focusing the how to balance the benefits and adverse effects. A 36-year-old female came to Dr. Zainoel Abidin Hospital, Banda Aceh, Indonesia with chief complaint of itchy and scaly red plaques almost all over the body. The patient also experienced pain in both knees, both ankle joints and index finger as well as thumb in the right hand in the last year. The patient was diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis, then treated with phototherapy and 15 mg of oral methotrexate each week for four weeks. Due to no improvement of the initial treatment, the patient received emollient and secukinumab at a dose of 300 mg/week subcutaneously for five weeks. The lesions began to disappear and the joint pain began to relieve. Secukinumab therapy was continued with a dose of 300 mg/month for six months. However, after six months, the patient complained of acnes appeared on the face. Therefore, the maintenance dose of secukinumab was decreased to 150 mg/month. After the reduced maintenance therapy was given, the patient came back with no complained of acnes. The erythematous plaques on trunk, back, arms and legs have subsided, as well as the joint pain. This case highlights that in a moderate-to-severe psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis, secukinumab is highly effective.

33835002,,A Case of Dapsone-induced Mild Methemoglobinemia with Dyspnea and Cyanosis.,Hayama Y||Imanishi H||Yoshimoto N||Sugawara K||Tsuruta D,"Dear Editor, Dapsone is a dual-function drug with antimicrobial and antiprotozoal effects and anti-inflammatory features (1). In dermatology, it is a first choice for conditions such as leprosy, IgA pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis, or an adjunctive treatment for, e.g. bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (1). However, dapsone is associated with some adverse effects, including methemoglobinemia (1). Methemoglobin (MetHb) concentrations of less than 15% usually cause no symptoms in patients with normal hemoglobin concentrations (2). Herein, we report the case of a patient with BP who developed dyspnea because of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia that was as mild as 4.7%. A 93-year-old man was diagnosed with BP based on skin manifestations (Figure 1, a and b), histopathological findings (Figure 1, c and d), and anti-BP180 NC16A antibody titer determined by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (279 U/mL) 3 years earlier. His comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, right pleural effusion, and brain infarction. The patient had been successfully treated with oral prednisolone, so the steroid was tapered to 4 mg/day. The blisters recurred, however, and new ones kept developing even though the prednisolone was increased to 25 mg/day. Dapsone (75 mg/day) was begun as adjunctive treatment, and new blister formation ceased. At one week from dapsone initiation, the patient developed dyspnea, and his oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry decreased to 88% on room air. At presentation, his blood pressure was 118/78 mmHg, the heart rate was 95 beats/minute, and axillary temperature was 36.3  degrees C. Neurological examination and consciousness findings remained unchanged compared with findings before dyspnea onset. Chest examination showed normal breath and heart sounds, but lip and peripheral cyanosis was present. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 12,920/mul; red blood cells, 370x104/mul; hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dl; and CMV antigenemia (or C7-HRP), negative. Chest CT and echocardiography indicated no remarkable change compared with imaging from one year earlier. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.454, PaO2 63.1 mmHg, PaCO2 35.4 mmHg, HCO3- 24.3 mmol/L, SaO2 92.4%, and MetHb of 4.7%. These findings indicated a saturation gap (difference between SpO2 and SaO2) induced by MetHb. Upon cessation of dapsone, MetHb levels and SpO2 returned to normal and the dyspnea resolved, implicating dapsone in the methemoglobinemia (Figure 1, e). Differential diagnoses were pulmonary disease, heart disease, neuromuscular disease, sepsis, and drug intoxication. These possibilities were ruled out by the physical examination, drug history, vital signs, blood tests, and chest CT and echocardiography. In normal individuals, MetHb levels are less than 1% (2). Healthy patients with normal hemoglobin concentrations develop cyanosis at MetHb level of 15-20%, dyspnea at 20-50%, and coma at 50-70%, and die at more than 70% (2). However, patients with hematologic disease, acidosis, or cardiopulmonary diseases, for example, present with symptoms even with MetHb levels less than 15% (2,3). We inferred that our patient presented with dyspnea even under mild methemoglobinemia because he had anemia, chronic heart failure, and right pleural effusion. The occurrence of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia with obvious symptoms is rare (1,4). Clinicians should be aware that methemoglobinemia symptoms are influenced not only by MetHb concentrations but also by comorbidities.",2020 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) associated with blinatumomab therapy is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of PCP in a patient undergoing blinatumomab therapy. A 70-year-old female diagnosed with Philadelphia-like CRLF2 overexpression B-cell precursor ALL received blinatumomab as consolidation therapy after achieving complete remission with prior induction chemotherapy. On the second day of blinatumomab infusion, she developed intermittent low-grade fever, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed subtle infiltrates and nodules. Despite empiric trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis, she progressed to significant shortness of breath and type I respiratory failure, with increased lactate dehydrogenase and beta-D-glucan assays. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities with scattered small nodules. The dry cough prompted next-generation sequencing of peripheral blood, which tested positive for pneumocystis jirovecii without evidence of other pathogens. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with PCP. The first cycle of blinatumomab had to be discontinued, and therapeutic dosages of TMP-SMX and dexamethasone were administered, resulting in full recovery and stable condition during follow-ups. CONCLUSION: PCP is rare in B-cell precursor ALL patients receiving blinatumomab therapy but manifests with early onset and rapid disease progression. Despite prophylaxis, PCP infection cannot be ignored during blinatumomab therapy. Therefore, heightened attention is warranted when using blinatumomab therapy.",2024,20240320.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia associated with blinatumomab therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia associated with blinatumomab therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,

In this case report, based on the efficacy of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and CEP, we aimed to show that the administration of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, when RA is complicated by an allergic disease, can stabilize the disease state and help avoid the adverse effects of long-term systemic glucocorticoid administration. PATIENTS CONCERNS: A 56-year-old woman developed RA at the age of 19 years. Treatment of the arthritis was initiated, but the joint destruction had progressed. At the age of 42, she developed eosinophilic pneumonia, which was relieved by glucocorticoid therapy. Since then, maintenance therapy has been continued with the diagnosis of CEP. She was treated with concomitant tacrolimus for persistent arthritis, and the prednisolone (PSL) dose was reduced to 3 mg/day after 10 years. However, around this time, an increase in peripheral blood eosinophil counts and respiratory symptoms was observed. DIAGNOSIS: The peripheral blood eosinophil count was 4000/microL and computed tomography revealed multiple ground-glass opacities in the peripheral lung fields. As interstitial pneumonia due to infection or other causes was ruled out, CEP relapse was diagnosed. INTERVENTIONS: Pneumonia rapidly recovered when the PSL dose was increased to 15 mg/day, and asymptomatic eosinophilic infiltrates reappeared in the lung field along with a relapse of arthritis when the PSL dose was reduced to 5 mg/day. Concomitant use of methotrexate and baricitinib has been introduced to suppress allergic reactions to pneumonia. OUTCOMES: After starting combination therapy with baricitinib and methotrexate, both arthritis and eosinophilia improved, and glucocorticoid-free remission was achieved. LESSONS: Recently, inhibition of IL-5 signaling via JAK2 has been reported to be effective in bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. Although complications of RA and CEP are not common, the actions of baricitinib are useful not only in arthritis but also in allergic diseases. The efficacy of some JAK inhibitors should be actively tested in patients with RA and these complications.",2023 Mar 31,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

39522022,PMC11550548,Sacituzumab-govitecan-induced severe acute tubulointerstitial nephritis requiring hemodialysis.,Guarin G||Netzel A||Flores KM||Cumpelik A||Bose R,"BACKGROUND: Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate that is FDA approved for refractory metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. It targets the human trophoblastic cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) with SN-38, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, attached to the antibody [1]. SN-38 breaks DNA strands and induces tumor apoptosis [2]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of its adverse effects mainly prerenal due to gastrointestinal toxicity, but it has not been reported to cause acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN). CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a rare adverse effect of sacituzumab govitecan, the approach to diagnosing the etiology of the patient's AKI, and the mechanism by which sacituzumab govitecan causes ATIN. A woman with metastatic ER positive, PR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer who was initiated on sacituzumab govitecan presents with vomiting and diarrhea, and findings of nephrotic-range proteinuria, negative anti-PLA2R antibody, and severe AKI requiring hemodialysis. She underwent kidney biopsy and pathology showed ATIN characterized by patchy interstitial inflammation alongside tubular injury without glomerular and vascular involvement. With intermittent renal replacement therapy, furosemide challenge, and a course of prednisone, the patient's kidney function recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Sacituzumab has a high affinity for Trop-2 protein which is also expressed within the collecting ducts, and to a lesser extent, the proximal tubule. Individuals, such as this patient, who express a homozygous genotype for UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for AKI from sacituzumab govitecan due to decreased glucuronidation of SN-38.",2024 Nov 9,20241109.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the adverse effects of a cancer treatment drug.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the adverse effects of a cancer treatment drug.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of sacituzumab govitecan, specifically acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of sacituzumab govitecan, specifically acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Here, we report the first case of unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) with anti-GQ1b antibody after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine. A 65-year-old man developed diplopia and ptosis in the right eye 17 days after vaccination, without preceding infection. Neurological examination revealed mild blepharoptosis, limitation of adduction, and vertical gaze on the right side. Increased levels of anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibody in the serum and albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid were detected. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed swelling and enhancement of the right oculomotor nerve. The patient was diagnosed with right ONP accompanied with anti-GQ1b antibody, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for 5 days was administered. The limitation of adduction and vertical gaze improved, and ptosis markedly resolved after IVIG treatment. Given the temporal sequence of disease progression, laboratory findings, and a favorable response to IVIG, a causal relationship cannot be ruled out between the occurrence of ONP and COVID-19 immunization.

However, much of the attention on the potential adverse effect is centered exclusively on clozapine, which remains the only antipsychotic medication in the United States requiring standardized monitoring of blood work. We demonstrate here that paliperidone can also cause neutropenia and therefore clinicians should be aware of this possibility especially during initiation of treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The following report presents the case of a 23-year-old African American male with first episode psychosis who developed neutropenia after initiation of paliperidone. Neutropenia resolved after discontinuation of paliperidone and initiation of an alternative antipsychotic, haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: This case report demonstrates an example of paliperidone induced neutropenia which resolved with a switch to haloperidol. We conclude that when initiating paliperidone, clinicians should be more aware of the risk of neutropenia. Moreover, neutropenia may be a more common and overlooked issue in patients on antipsychotic medications other than clozapine and increased awareness of comparative risk across antipsychotics could help direct treatment.",2021 Feb 6,20210206.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses neutropenia as an adverse effect of the antipsychotic medication paliperidone, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses neutropenia as an adverse effect of the antipsychotic medication paliperidone, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
34647821,,Severe cisplatin-induced renal toxicity in a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum.,Gilbar PJ||Pokharel K,"INTRODUCTION: Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare genetic disorder of DNA repair, defined by extreme sensitivity to sunlight, leading to sunburn, skin pigmentation and increased incidence of skin cancers. Cisplatin acts by interfering with DNA repair mechanisms to cause DNA damage and apoptosis. It has indications in many malignancies including bladder, head and neck and lung cancers. Acute kidney injury is a well-known complication of cisplatin. CASE REPORT: We report a 42-year-old male with a long history of Xeroderma pigmentosum treated with adjuvant cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) in combination with radiotherapy for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the neck. He presented to clinic prior to his second weekly dose of cisplatin with a severe acute kidney injury and a creatine level of 813 mmol/L and eGFR of 7 mL/min. No myelosuppression was present. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Treatment consisted of aggressive electrolyte and fluid management. Creatinine levels slowly improved with conservative management without the need for dialysis. Radiation was completed without further cisplatin. DISCUSSION: Three cases of severe adverse effects from cisplatin administration in patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum have been reported, with all fatal. Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C plays an important role in the DNA repair process with the recognition and repair of damage to normal cells following cisplatin. Patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum can be carriers of defective Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C and if the degree of Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C inactivity is significant, fatalities could occur.

34493233,PMC8425141,Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: a case report and review of the literature.,Zhu A||Connolly P||Hakimi AA,"BACKGROUND: A renal artery aneurysm is a rare clinical presentation that can be found incidentally on imaging or during workup for refractory hypertension. Its presentation can be similar to that of a renal artery pseudoaneurysm, but the etiologies of the two vascular lesions differ. We present a patient who had an incidental finding of a large renal artery aneurysm that was managed with endovascular embolization. We also describe the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation and management of both renal artery aneurysms and renal artery pseudoaneurysms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old man was referred to a urologic oncologist for workup of a newly found renal mass. Initial imaging with computed tomography showed a homogenous, well-circumscribed mass arising from the right kidney. Further evaluation with Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated pulsatile flow within the renal mass that was concerning for a renal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient initially underwent a diagnostic angiogram by interventional radiology and was found to have a true renal artery aneurysm. Interventional radiology considered placement of a covered stent or angioembolization, but treatment was deferred due to concern for compromising the patient's renal function. Patient was subsequently transferred to a neighboring hospital for management by vascular surgery. After considering both open surgical and endovascular approaches, the patient ultimately underwent angioembolization of the renal artery aneurysm. Short-term follow-up showed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with minimal adverse effects to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our case report documents a unique case of an incidentally found large renal artery aneurysm that was successfully managed with endovascular embolization. Renal artery aneurysms and renal artery pseudoaneurysms, which can present similarly on imaging, are important diagnostic considerations in a patient presenting with a new renal mass. While open surgical approaches can be used to repair aneurysms, endovascular approaches using stenting or angioembolization are safe and effective options for treating renal aneurysms and renal pseudoaneurysms.",2021 Sep 7,20210907.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': ""The article focuses on renal artery aneurysms and doesn't discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications."", 'score': 2}",The article focuses on renal artery aneurysms and doesn't discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of renal artery aneurysm management and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of renal artery aneurysm management and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Prompt cessation of heparin and initiation of non-heparin anticoagulation is the standard of care for HIT. Nevertheless, the treatment can pose challenges, particularly in refractory HIT, in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, or those requiring urgent surgery. Additionally, in rare cases, conventional anticoagulation therapy is not effective, necessitating alternative treatments such as plasma exchange (PLEX) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). CASE REPORT Here, we report the case of a 57-year-old male patient who developed mild acute cellular rejection, refractory HIT, and disseminated intravascular coagulation after liver transplant surgery. Heparin was stopped and argatroban was initiated for thromboembolism treatment, but hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in the setting of refractory HIT and caused transplant failure. The patient underwent a second liver transplant 1 month after the first surgery. He had 2 sessions of PLEX and received 1 dose of IVIG before and 1 dose during the operation. Despite advanced treatment with PLEX and IVIG, the refractory HIT persisted. Hepatic artery thrombosis recurred within 2 weeks and the transplant failed again despite catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolysis and argatroban therapy. CONCLUSIONS Recently perioperative PLEX and IVIG have been used a few times for the treatment of refractory HIT. This is the first reported case of a liver transplant recipient with refractory HIT who underwent this treatment strategy. Further investigation is required to determine the efficacy and safety of preoperative and intraoperative administration of PLEX and IVIG, especially in liver transplant recipients with HIT.",2023 Dec 30,20231230.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of refractory heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in a liver transplant recipient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of refractory heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in a liver transplant recipient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Maribavir (MBV) is a novel oral antiviral, known for its favourable safety profile in fragile patients. We describe a case of CMV disease with end organ damage following kidney transplantation at high risk, for recipient-donor serological mismatch. A 54-year-old female with history of obesity, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, on prednisone and tacrolimus after kidney transplantation in November 2022, soon after developed primary CMV infection, treated with Valganciclovir and CMV Ig. In January 2023 the patient presented with fever and dyspnea. Pulmonary miliary opacities and right-upper lobe consolidation were found at CT-scan along with CMV-DNA positivity on BAL and serum. Lung biopsy confirmed CMV infection. Antiviral was switched to Ganciclovir. Despite initial benefit, fever and respiratory failure happened 8 days later, leading to intubation at day 15. Due to slow decrease serum CMV-DNA and detection of UL97 mutation, conferring resistance to valganciclovir and ganciclovir, the patient was started on foscarnet and letermovir. She was extubated after a gradual respiratory improvement and discharged from ICU to rehabilitation department with HFNC; reduction in serum CMV-DNA, but persistently elevated CMV-DNA on BAL were documented. At week 8, MBV was started and letermovir continued, for a 8 weeks course, without notable adverse effects. Respiratory function improved but soon after septic shock occurred. A bone marrow biopsy resulted in lymphoma, without indications for treatment: the patient developed coma and died 6 months after admission. MBV has recently been approved in Europe for treatment of R/R CMV in HSCT and SOT recipients. MBV showed superior rates of viraemia clearance after 8 weeks compared to SOC, demonstrating also a favourable safety profile with fewer patients discontinuing treatment and being affected by nephrotoxicity and neutropenia. Its main side effects are taste impairment, gastro-intestinal symptoms and asthenia. Based on actual promising perspectives regarding antiviral stewardship, more data are required to corroborate benefit of MBV in terms of toxicity and impact on mortality in highly fragile populations as SOT recipients. MBV received approval for the treatment of refractory or resistant CMV infections to other antiviral agents. Nevertheless, real-life data on efficacy and safety of MBV are still lacking. We conducted a narrative review of the current literature on MBV as treatment for CMV infection in kidney transplant recipients to understand clinical characteristics, safety and outcomes of MBV in this population. A search was run on the main scientific databases. 194 papers were identified, of which 188 were excluded by title and abstract evaluation. Subsequently, 6 papers were included. We performed descriptive statistics on the entire study population. The studies included in our analysis showed a higher prevalence of male subjects. The median age was 57 year. CKD was the most frequently reported comorbidity. Seven patients reported a donor/recipient mismatch (D+/R-). The case report and the cohort of patients collected from the literature show that MBV was used as an option in R/R CMV, notably for the presence or suspicion of CMV resistance to previous treatment. The clinical presentation of CMV in kidney SOT was heterogenous and varied from isolated reactivation of CMV-DNAemia, isolated fever or gastrointestinal involvement. For mild to moderate CMV disease, as with the cases reported in our review, or for proven ganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir resistance, MBV could be a valuable option. Outcomes of the patients treated with MBV were not reported in all the studies; however, where reported, 45.4% of the cases developed virological failure during MBV treatment with the development of specific resistance to MBV. MBV was generally well-tolerated, with low rates of toxicity, normally reversible.

36383917,,Clozapine-Induced Fever and Plasma Cytokine Changes in a Patient With Schizophrenia.,Nakamura M||Nagamine T,"INTRODUCTION: Clozapine-induced fever is frequently documented in the early stages of administration. Fever during clozapine treatment often presents a clinical challenge, because there are no established guideline to decide when fever is the adverse effect. Although the etiology of clozapine-induced fevers remains unknown, evidence has suggested that fever may develop secondarily to a generalized inflammatory response as a manifestation of the immune-modulating effects of clozapine. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a 59-year-old male patient with a treatment-resistant schizophrenia, who was introduced clozapine for the first time. He became febrile on day 14 at 75 mg/d. He was diagnosed clozapine-induced fever, which was improved by dose reduction on day 27 at 25 mg/d. However, we noticed significant high levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine on day 29, which resulted in withdrawal of clozapine. Also, we found continuous eosinophilia on day 33. After we provided conservative therapy with appropriate intravenous fluids, his kidney function and eosinophilic counts returned to normal on day 59 and day 53, respectively. The time-sequential changes of levels of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha suggested that the upregulated cytokines play a role on clozapine-induced fever and subsequent eosinophilia under severe renal failure condition. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case presentation of clozapine-induced fever discussing the mechanism, differential diagnosis, and decision making of clozapine treatment focusing on plasma cytokines.

There have been few reports in the literature on visual disturbance in patients on long-term treatment with Anastrozole for breast cancer prevention; but none had symptoms worse than blurry vision and/or xerostomia. The present patient had acute onset of right-sided vision loss without other neurologic deficits while using the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole for breast cancer treatment. CASE REPORT A 69-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with approximately 1 month of worsening right eye vision loss that was not associated with any other neurologic deficits or any acute symptoms. The symptom was constant and without alleviating or aggravating factors. After extensive workup with ophthalmologic evaluation, Infectious Disease evaluation, autoimmune tests, brain imaging, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis, and temporal artery biopsy reporting unremarkable results, it was determined that the patient was in an inflammatory state induced by long-term use of Anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor.

In renal biopsy specimens, tubulitis with eosinophilic infiltration is suggestive of DI-AIN. Although corticosteroid therapy and discontinuation of the offending drug can improve renal dysfunction in most cases of DI-AIN, some patients experience AIN recurrence, leading to corticosteroid dependency. Corticosteroid-dependent eosinophilic interstitial nephritis presents a difficult dilemma in diagnosis and information regarding optimum management is limited. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 25-year-old man, who received treatment with carbamazepine, zonisamide, valproate, and lacosamide for temporal lobe epilepsy, showed an increase in serum creatinine level from 0.98 to 1.29 mg/dL over a period of 6 months. Although he exhibited no symptoms, his serum creatinine level continued to increase to 1.74 mg/dL. DIAGNOSIS: Renal biopsy revealed tubulitis and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates with eosinophils. Immunological and ophthalmological examinations showed no abnormal findings, and thus, his renal dysfunction was presumed to be caused by DI-AIN. Although oral prednisolone (PSL) administration (40 mg/d) and discontinuation of zonisamide immediately improved his renal function, AIN recurred 10 months later. The increase in PSL dose along with discontinuation of valproate and lacosamide improved renal function. However, 10 months later, recurrent AIN with eosinophilic infiltration was confirmed by further biopsy. The patient was therefore diagnosed with corticosteroid-dependent eosinophilic interstitial nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: To prevent life-threatening epilepsy, carbamazepine could not be discontinued; hence, he was treated with an increased dose of PSL (60 mg/d) and 1500 mg/d of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). OUTCOMES: MMF was well tolerated and PSL was successfully tapered to 5 mg/d; renal function stabilized over a 20-month period. LESSONS: The presence of underdetermined autoimmune processes and difficulties in discontinuing the putative offending drug discontinuation are contributing factors to corticosteroid dependency in patients with eosinophilic interstitial nephritis.

Other centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine may represent a therapeutic alternative or adjunct during physostigmine shortage; however, previous reports of use have not documented serum antimuscarinic toxin concentrations, limiting evaluation of effectiveness. Combination therapy with physostigmine and rivastigmine has not been described. In this report, the authors present a case of diphenhydramine-induced antimuscarinic delirium with elevated diphenhydramine serum concentrations treated with physostigmine and transdermal rivastigmine without observed adverse effect. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old female presented to an emergency department after ingesting 3.75 g (41.2 mg/kg) of diphenhydramine. She had antimuscarinic delirium with a presenting serum diphenhydramine concentration of 1500 ng/mL (therapeutic range, 25-112 ng/mL) and required two doses of physostigmine to avert intubation prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. At hospital hour 22, in the ICU, antimuscarinic delirium persisted but no further physostigmine was available due to hospital shortage. Therefore, a 9.5-mg transdermal rivastigmine patch was applied. By hospital hour 24, her delirium had resolved. A serum diphenhydramine concentration at hospital hour 25 was elevated at 760 ng/mL. Transdermal rivastigmine was discontinued at hospital hour 48 without recurrent delirium. Despite persistent normal mental status after rivastigmine discontinuation, the patient had a dry mouth, difficulty urinating, and mydriasis until hospital day 5. She never developed muscarinic toxicity. DISCUSSION: Transdermal rivastigmine may be a useful treatment alternative or adjunct during physostigmine shortage for antimuscarinic delirium and has a long duration of action without aspiration risk. Muscarinic toxicity was not observed.",2023 Apr,20221227.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not meet the specified criteria because it focuses on diphenhydramine-induced delirium, not complications of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article does not meet the specified criteria because it focuses on diphenhydramine-induced delirium, not complications of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of diphenhydramine-induced antimuscarinic delirium and its treatment, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of diphenhydramine-induced antimuscarinic delirium and its treatment, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,
38970243,PMC11322792,Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia Induced by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor and Anti-TIGIT Therapy.,Mohammed A||Tang B||Sadikot S||Barmaimon G,"BACKGROUND Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been linked to various immune-related adverse events, including pneumonitis, necessitating early recognition and potential treatment discontinuation. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) induced by ICIs, particularly with no reported cases involving anti-TIGIT therapy, is rare. This report describes a case of AEP following treatment with pembrolizumab and anti-TIGIT therapy. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old woman with lung adenoid cystic carcinoma and chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure on long-term oxygen therapy presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She underwent left pneumonectomy and radiation therapy at diagnosis 9 years earlier. She was participating in a clinical trial using pembrolizumab and anti-TIGIT EOS-448, due to cancer progression. After starting therapy, she developed stable peripheral eosinophilia and a skin rash, suggestive of a drug reaction. On admission, she was in acute-on-chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, febrile, with an elevated eosinophil count and new multifocal infiltrates in the right lung. Despite broad antibiotics coverage for pneumonia, she developed worsening respiratory symptoms and eosinophilia. She was then empirically started on intravenous methylprednisolone for acute eosinophilic pneumonia without confirmatory bronchoscopy as she was at high risk with her previous pneumonectomy. She subsequently had rapid improvement in her symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AEP should be considered in patients treated with ICIs who develop immune-related adverse effects. Although bronchoscopy findings are part of AEP's diagnostic criteria, this case underscores the importance of clinical judgment in the prompt initiation of steroids, even without confirmatory bronchoscopy, in rapidly progressing cases. The role of anti-TIGIT therapy in this context remains uncertain.",2024 Jul 6,20240706.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-TIGIT therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-TIGIT therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,
36751936,,Drug Eruption From Atorvastatin: With Initial Misdiagnosis of Tinea Cruris.,Hanson K||Mattes RG||Cauthon KAB,"Objective To present the case of a Latin man 68 years of age who presented to the emergency department with a rash to the right side of his groin 10 weeks after switching from simvastatin 40 mg daily to atorvastatin 40 mg daily. Background Prior to switching to atorvastatin, the patient had been taking simvastatin for 21 years without rash. The rash progressed bilaterally to his arms and hands, legs, buttocks, back, and trunk before the patient was seen by dermatology and atorvastatin was discontinued. Results Within six weeks of discontinuation of atorvastatin, the rash resolved with remaining pigmentation changes. The adverse effect was documented in the patient's chart, and dermatology recommended avoiding other statins in the future. Settings Ambulatory clinic pharmacy practice, emergency room, or urgent care centers. Practice Considerations Atorvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor or statin that has been FDA approved for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and treatment of hypercholesterolemia since 1996. Despite widespread use of atorvastatin over many years, only a handful of published cases report drug eruption from its use.

In addition, pregnant patients who are unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 have greater morbidity risk with severe COVID-19 disease as compared to patients of similar age and comorbidity status. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been deemed safe in pregnancy in other diseases. Prior data demonstrate the possible benefit of utilizing IVIG for the treatment in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 active infections when administered within 14 days of COVID symptom onset. CASE REPORT We administered IVIG (Privigen(R), CSL Behring) 0.5 g/kg daily for 3 consecutive days to 4 pregnant patients (ages 24-34 years of age) who were hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. All patients received concomitant glucocorticoid therapy. Gestational ages were 26, 17, 35, and 35 weeks. All patients were discharged home breathing room air after a mean hospital stay of 15 days. Two patients had uncomplicated cesarean section at 35 weeks during the hospitalization. The pre-term pregnancies at 17 and 26 weeks were intact at hospital discharge and resulted in normal vaginal deliveries at term. All 4 patients consented to participate in this case series report.

CASE REPORT A 77-year-old man with chronic renal failure had an esophageal-skin fistula after he had surgeries for removal of esophageal and gastric cancers and reconstruction using jejunum, and he showed a cavity, tree-in-bud formation, and pleural effusions in his left upper lung fields on his chest X-ray after treatment of cellulitis and bacteremia/candidemia by meropenem, teicoplanin, and micafungin. M. tuberculosis was isolated from his sputum and exudate fluid from the reconstructed esophageal-skin fistula. Although he could not take antimycobacterial agents orally, treatment was started with intravenous agents combining levofloxacin (LVFX) every other day, isoniazid (INH), and linezolid (LZD). However, his platelets were decreased 21 days after treatment started, and it was thought to be an adverse effect of LZD and/or INH. After changing LZD to tedizolid (TZD), in addition to changing from INH to intramuscular streptomycin twice per week, his platelet counts increased. Intravenous TZD could be continued, and it maintained his condition without exacerbations of thrombocytopenia and renal failure. The M. tuberculosis disappeared, and the abnormal chest X-ray shadows were improved 2 months after the start of treatment.

Several drug classes have been associated with the development of a systemic sarcoid-like reaction, which defines drug-induced sarcoidosis-like reactions and can affect a single organ. Anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab) have rarely been reported as responsible for this reaction and this adverse effect has mainly been described during the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. We report a unique case of a sarcoid-like reaction complicating rituximab following the treatment of a mantle cell lymphoma and interesting only the kidney. The 60-year-old patient presented with severe acute renal failure 6 months after the end of his r-CHOP protocol and the urgent renal biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis rich in granulomas without caseous necrosis. After ruling out other causes of granulomatous nephritis, a sarcoid-like reaction was retained since infiltration was limited to the kidney. The temporal relationship between rituximab administration and the sarcoid-like reaction onset in our patient supported the diagnosis of a rituximab-induced sarcoidosis-like reaction.

DESIGN: Video description of the case and surgical procedure. SETTING: Hospital affiliated to a university. PATIENT: A 35-year-old woman with G7P1A5L1 was admitted with a heterotopic cervical pregnancy 21 days after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (the corrected gestational age was 5(+2) weeks). The serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 24,530 mIU/mL at the corrected gestational age of 5(+3) weeks. Ultrasound examination on the day of admission showed that there was a gestational sac in the cervical canal (1.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm, yolk sac visible) and another in the intrauterine cavity (1.2 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm, yolk sac visible). The pregnant woman and her partner strongly urged to remove the cervical gestational sac and continue the intrauterine pregnancy to term. INTERVENTION: After the Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, hysteroscopic surgery with bipolar resectoscope and transabdominal ultrasound guidance was used to resect the heterotopic cervical pregnancy while preserving the intrauterine gestational sac. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The heterotopic cervical pregnancy was completely resected by hysteroscopy, and the normal gestational sac in the uterine cavity was successfully preserved. RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided hysteroscopic surgery allowed us to successfully preserve the intrauterine pregnancy while removing the cervical pregnancy completely. During the operation, the dilation pressure and the flow rate of the dilation fluid was kept as low as possible to avoid excessive intrauterine pressure and excessive dilation fluid entering the intrauterine cavity, which could have had adverse effects on the intrauterine pregnancy sac. No surgical- or anesthesia-related complications occurred. The pathological results confirmed placental villi and decidual tissue. The one-month follow-up ultrasonography showed a live single intrauterine pregnancy with cardiac activity.

OBJECTIVE: This review analyzes the results of treating CAWs with a porcine biological mesh and topical negative pressure (TNP) to address the feasibility, effectiveness, level of risk, and overall results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 4 consecutive cases treated with the biologic mesh and TNP at the General Surgery Unit of the Cannizzaro Hospital (Catania, Italy) is reported and analyzed. In addition, a review of the literature published in all languages from 2000 to 2015 in the MEDLINE/PubMed database was performed to identify cases of CAWs treated with the association of biologic mesh and TNP. RESULTS: Taking into account the authors' experience and review of literature, a total of 12 patients (4 treated in the authors' department) were treated with the aforementioned combination. The main indications for using this association were a large abdominal wall defect, laparotomy, or wound dehiscence and wound infection. In almost all cases, this combination demonstrated a successful outcome with a clear improvement in wound healing and no adverse effects.

When these tissue- and liquid-based approaches give differing results, they are known as discordant or being at variance. MSI-H tumors are well-researched candidates for treatment with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor-based immunotherapy, but the efficacy of immunotherapy in MSI-H discordant endometrial cancer, especially as first-line therapy, is not yet well documented in the literature. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman presented with a retroperitoneal mass positive for recurrent adenocarcinoma of endometrial origin. Her stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma 7 years ago demonstrated microsatellite stable (MSS) by immunohistochemical (IHC) stain and indeterminant due to insufficient tissue by Caris Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). She then presented with a retroperitoneal mass that was MSI-H on IHC stain and Caris NGS, as well as MSI high on liquid biopsy @Guardant360 (@G360). The patient proceeded with pembrolizumab treatment 1 year ago and has sustained a complete clinical response at the time of writing. CONCLUSIONS Our case provides further evidence for the need to retest the microsatellite stability of metastatic sites, especially after a long disease-free survival. Here, we providing a literature review of case reports and a review of studies outlining discordance of testing modalities. Our case also highlights the importance of considering the use of immunotherapy as a first-line agent in patients who may have a poor ECOG performance status, as it can significantly improve their quality of life and reduce the number of adverse effects compared to chemotherapy.",2023 Jun 29,20230629.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of endometrial adenocarcinoma and its treatment with pembrolizumab, focusing on microsatellite stability rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of endometrial adenocarcinoma and its treatment with pembrolizumab, focusing on microsatellite stability rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
38213293,,Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Following Prenatal Use of Supplements Containing Tianeptine.,Ikeri K||Anderson A||Eyal F||Whitehurst R,"Tianeptine is an opioid receptor agonist that is prescribed as an antidepressant in many countries. In the United States, tianeptine is not approved for medical use because of its potential for abuse and addiction. Nonetheless, products containing tianeptine are easily obtainable and are marketed as dietary supplements. There are increasing reports of adverse effects and fatal toxicities resulting from tianeptine use among adolescents and adults. This emerging public health threat could escalate the opioid epidemic and drive increased newborn perinatal exposure. The impact of in utero exposure to tianeptine has not been studied, and to our knowledge, the authors of only 1 report have documented possible neonatal effects. Here, we describe a case of chronic prenatal exposure to tianeptine in the setting of maternal dependence on dietary supplements. This infant developed signs of severe withdrawal shortly after birth that were refractory to treatment with oral phenobarbital but responded to subsequent oral morphine therapy. On further questioning, the mother revealed the use of a tianeptine-containing dietary supplement. We did not perform confirmatory toxicology testing because tianeptine is not assayed by usual urine drug screening tests. For infants with clinical signs of opioid withdrawal without known etiology, we suggest that the maternal interview should inquire about the use of neurotropic over-the-counter drugs.",2024 Jan 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.

We present a case of a young man with a constellation of symptoms and myopericarditis as a complication of this disease. CASE: A 36-year-old Hispanic man with no significant past medical history developed a quotidian fever pattern following an upper respiratory tract infection. He initially presented with chest pain concerning for myocardial infarction and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. He was found to have myopericarditis, significant neutrophilic leukocytosis, and hyperferritinemia. He improved on high-dose corticosteroids but developed steroid-induced psychosis, and 4 months from symptom onset, he finally received tocilizumab, which eventually induced remission without adverse reactions. DISCUSSION: Adult-onset Still's disease should be considered in a patient with fevers of undetermined origin. Due to its multisystemic involvement, adult-onset Still's disease is often a diagnosis arrived at after an extensive cardiac, hematologic, malignant, and infectious workup. Imaging, laboratory testing, and bone marrow biopsy were necessary to rule out alternative etiologies of this patient's presentation. Steroids are the mainstay of treatment because they are easily affordable, although the high risk of adverse effects makes them less desirable. Interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra or canakinumab) and interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab are the steroid-sparing biologic agents of choice but are cost-prohibitive. CONCLUSION: Adult-onset Still's disease should be considered in the differential diagnoses of fever of undetermined origin.

31753622,,Treatment of acute naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal with buprenorphine.,Chhabra N||Aks SE,"Naloxone is a frequently utilized and effective treatment to reverse the life-threatening effects of illicit opioid intoxication. Excessive naloxone dosing in these circumstances, however, may lead to naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal in individuals with opioid dependence. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, is increasingly utilized in the Emergency Department (ED) for the treatment of opioid withdrawal syndrome but little is known regarding its utility in cases of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal. We report a case of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal that was effectively treated with sublingual buprenorphine. An older male was brought into the ED with signs and symptoms of opioid toxicity that was successfully treated with pre-hospital naloxone by Emergency Medical Services. He had a clinical opioid withdrawal scale (COWS) or 10 with abdominal cramping and unintentional defecation. After a discussion of treatment options and possible adverse effects with the patient, the decision was made to administer 4 mg/1 mg of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone film. The patient reported a rapid improvement in symptoms and at 30 min posttreatment, his COWS was 4. His COWS decreased to 3 at 1 h and this was sustained for 4 h of observation. The patient was subsequently discharged to a treatment facility for opioid use disorder. This case highlights the potential of buprenorphine as a treatment modality for acute naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal. Due to the risks of worsening or sustained buprenorphine-precipitated opioid withdrawal, further research is warranted to identify patients who may benefit from this therapy.",2020 Mar,20191116.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of opioid withdrawal precipitated by naloxone, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the treatment of opioid withdrawal precipitated by naloxone, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

A real life study.,Duran Barata D||Jaureguizar Oriol A||Loarce Martos J||Morell Hita JL||de la Puente Bujidos C||Rigual Bobillo J,"INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung diseases associated with systemic autoimmune diseases (ILD-SAD) can progress to a fibrotic form that can benefit from antifibrotic treatment. The aim of the study is to describe a cohort of patients with ILD-SAD who manifest progressive pulmonary fibrosis treated with antifibrotics. METHODS: Single-centre retrospective observational study from a tertiary care hospital on a cohort of patients with ILD-SAD with progressive pulmonary fibrosis evaluated in a joint pulmonology and rheumatology clinic that initiated treatment with antifibrotic drugs between 01/01/2019 and 01/12/2021. Clinical characteristics were analysed. The evolution of pulmonary function test and adverse effects during treatment were described. RESULTS: 18 patients were included. The mean age was 66.7 +/- 12.7 years, with a higher frequency of females (66.7%). Systemic sclerosis (SS) was the most frequent systemic autoimmune disease (36.8%). The majority of patients were receiving systemic glucocorticoid treatment (88.9%), 72.2% of patients were receiving treatment with disease-modifying drugs, the most frequent being mycophenolate mofetil (38.9%), and 22.2% with rituximab. Functional stability was observed after the start of antifibrotic treatment. Two patients died during follow-up, one due to progression of ILD. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a beneficial effect of antifibrotic treatment added to immunomodulatory treatment in patients with fibrotic ILD-SAD in real life. In our cohort, patients with ILD-SAD with progressive fibrosing involvement show functional stability after starting antifibrotic treatment.

Here we present a case of bilateral PTX-induced keratoconjunctivitis. A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department with symptoms of red eye, purulent discharge, and foreign body sensation in both eyes. On slit lamp examination, epithelial defects in both eyes with a ring-shaped corneal stromal infiltrate in the right eye and a marginal stromal infiltrate in the left eye were noted. High-resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography (HR-AS-OCT) showed stromal hyperreflectivity and Descemet folds. Bacterial, fungal, and amoebic cultures were taken. Empirical treatment with topical dexamethasone as well as antibiotics and systemic doxycycline was started. The next day the patient stated that he had been handling zoanthid coral without gloves and had rubbed his eyes afterward. Bilateral PTX-induced keratoconjunctivitis was diagnosed. His eyes were irrigated abundantly with saline solution, and umbilical cord serum eye drops were added to the treatment. Treatment was tapered according to improvement of the corneal infiltrates and epithelial defects. After four months, the stromal infiltrates were resolved but corneal scars persisted in both eyes. HR-AS-OCT showed anterior stromal hyperreflectivity corresponding to corneal leucomas.

However, the procedure is not always effective, and may allow AH to progress to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC). Two young women with AH who wished to preserve their fertility developed EEC following 52-mg LNG-IUS in insertion at our institution. One was a 34-year-old woman diagnosed with endometrial cancer 2 years after LNG-IUS insertion. The second was a 30-year-old woman diagnosed 17 months after LNG-IUS insertion. Proactive molecular risk classification for endometrial cancer (ProMisE) classification revealed that the first and second patients had p53-abnormal (p53abn) EEC and mismatch repair deficient (MMR-d) EEC, respectively. MMR-d and p 53abn were frequently observed in both AH and EEC specimens. Studies suggest that MMR-d and p53abn are predictors of the occurrence adverse effects after fertility-preserving treatment for EEC. AH is a precursor of EEC. Therefore, p53 and mismatch repair (MMR) mutation may be used to identify women with AH who will not likely benefit from progestin therapy. Molecular assays in women with AH will likely be useful for identifying novel predictive biomarkers of progestin resistance and to improve the safety of conservative treatment.

IBD-associated liver diseases may have a variety of etiopathogenetic origins (including shared autoimmune pathogenesis, the effect of chronic inflammatory status, and adverse effects of drugs). Nevertheless, acute granulomatous hepatitis in the setting of Crohn's disease (CD) is a rare clinical entity. It warrants, however, a careful assessment as both clinical and pathological features of Crohn's-associated granulomatous hepatitis closely mimic extrapulmonary hepatic sarcoidosis, with considerable overlaps between the 2 diseases, which certainly makes a definitive diagnosis quite challenging. It is crucial to exclude infectious etiologies during the evaluation of acute granulomatous hepatitis, as inappropriate immunosuppressive treatment may cause a systemic flare-up of an underlying liver infection. We report a rare case of a 35-year-old female with a history of CD who presented with recurrent fevers, acute abdominal pain, and cholestasis. She was found to have acute hepatitis with noncaseating granulomas on liver biopsy. A comprehensive diagnostic workup did not ultimately prove a specific etiological culprit. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids, and she demonstrated a positive clinical and laboratory response to the treatment. Our case highlights the diagnostic dilemma of acute granulomatous hepatitis in the setting of co-existent CD with a multisystemic syndrome. Granulomatous hepatitis represents a relatively rare manifestation of both extraintestinal CD and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, with potential difficulties discriminating between the 2 entities on many occasions. The case also demonstrates the value of an interdisciplinary approach in the context of multisystemic disease to achieve the best outcome.",2022 Jan-Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': ""The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of granulomatous hepatitis in a patient with Crohn's disease."", 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of granulomatous hepatitis in a patient with Crohn's disease.,2,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article discusses a case of acute granulomatous hepatitis in a patient with Crohn's disease and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria."", 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of acute granulomatous hepatitis in a patient with Crohn's disease and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
36775960,,Should we routinely add CRP to clozapine titrations? - Learning from three cases.,Shelton C||Ruan CJ||Ertugrul A||Cotes RO||De Leon J,"Objectives: An international guideline recently provided certain personalized schedules for titrating clozapine in adult inpatients by considering: 1) DNA ancestry group, 2) sexsmoking subgroup, and 3) presence/absence of clozapine poor metabolizer (PM) status. Measuring CRP levels at baseline and during the first 4 weeks is recommended. Titrations too fast for the metabolism of specific patients can lead to clozapine-induced inflammations and CRP elevations. Methods: Three published cases are reinterpreted. Better outcomes might have been obtained by using the guideline. Results: Case 1 was a Chinese male non-smoker, a clozapine PM due to an underlying inflammation. Case 2 was a Turkish female non-smoker who developed clozapine-induced myocarditis in the context of 4 risk factors (undiagnosed infl ammation, obesity, valproate and olanzapine co-prescription). Case 3 was a United States patient of European ancestry with no known risk factors who developed myocarditis after a routine titration and had an unsuccessful rechallenge with 12.5 mg/day. Application of the international clozapine titration guideline may have prevented: 1) Case 1 by recommending against clozapine titration for a patient with an abnormal CRP level, 2) Case 2 by considering 4 risk factors and using a slow titration for clozapine PMs, and 3) Case 3 by using CRP elevations for early identification of a possible genetic PM. Conclusions: When baseline or prior CRPs are normal and then become abnormal during a clozapine titration, this indicates: 1) clozapine-induced inflammation associated with too-rapid titration for that specific patient, and/or 2) co-occurrence of an infection. Prospective studies need to verify this hypothesis.",2022 Dec 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on clozapine titration and inflammation.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on clozapine titration and inflammation.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the titration of clozapine and its associated complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the titration of clozapine and its associated complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

It is usually a self-limiting illness that typically spontaneously resolves without therapeutic intervention. However, when the papules are extensive or refractory causing complications or aesthetic issues, multiple treatment modalities exist to relieve symptoms, limit spread and decrease the social stigma associated with visible lesions. Treatment is especially important in HIV/AIDS infected populations, where prevalence is estimated between 5% and 18% and susceptibility to larger, widespread and recalcitrant lesions involving atypical distributions is more common. We evaluated a 38-year-old woman with a history of AIDS (CD4+ T cell count <25 cells/microL) and poor adherence with antiretroviral therapy who presented with a 9-month history of persistent, progressively worsening facial and truncal umbilicated papules consistent with recalcitrant MC refractory to cidofovir injections.

The ability of this organism to efficiently establish latent infection has enabled it to spread to nearly one-third of individuals worldwide. Approximately 8 million new cases of active tuberculosis disease occur each year, leading to about 1.7 million deaths. The disease incidence is magnified by the concurrent epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus infection. A total of 1.3 million people died from tuberculosis in 2022. In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis worldwide, including 5.8 million men, 3.5 million women, and 1.3 million children. We report a case of thyroid tuberculosis presenting as multinodular goiter. Neck ultrasound was done and revealed abscess collection on the background of multinodular colloid goiter. The diagnosis of thyroid tuberculosis was confirmed by a positive GeneXpert of the pus sample and the presence of extensive caseous necrosis on cytopathology examination. Furthermore, anterior neck swelling may provide a diagnostic challenge by clinically mimicking multinodular goiter or thyroid neoplasms. Owing to its rarity and its tendency to pose a clinical diagnostic challenge, we decided to report it. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old retired female Ethiopian high-school teacher presented to University of Gondar Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia with firm, nontender multinodular anterior neck swelling measuring at largest 2 x 3 cm that moves with swallowing. GeneXpert of the pus sample and cytopathology examination confirmed the diagnosis of thyroid tuberculosis, and the patient was started on 2 rifampicin-ethambutol-isoniazid-pyrazinamide/4 rifampicin-isoniazid 3 tablets by mouth/day, which is defined as the preferred first-line anti-tuberculosis regimen in Ethiopia, and pyridoxine 50 mg by mouth per day for 6 months. Since then, she has been followed with regular liver function tests. The patient has shown a smooth course with no significant adverse effects encountered. Currently, the patient has completed her anti-tuberculosis treatment and is doing well. CONCLUSION: In the clinical evaluation of a patient with anterior neck swelling, tuberculosis must be considered as a differential diagnosis in subjects from endemic areas for early diagnostic workup and management.",2024 Jul 9,20240709.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of thyroid tuberculosis and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of thyroid tuberculosis and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,
36751921,,Geriatric Pharmacotherapy Case Series: Recurrent Angioedema Following Discontinuation of ACE Inhibitor Therapy.,Perman B||Narechania S||Malesker M,"Introduction Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are first-line pharmaceutical agents in common chronic conditions such as hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. When angioedema occurs, if secondary to ACEIs, discontinuation of the ACEI is necessary to mitigate the risk of recurrent angioedema. While angioedema is a well-known adverse effect of ACEIs, it is not well-known that angioedema may recur even after ACEI discontinuation. Additionally, only few reports in the literature describe this phenomenon. This case describes an older man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and heart failure who presented from an assisted living facility with recurrent angioedema 12 days after an initial episode of angioedema where his ACEI therapy (enalapril) was discontinued. Assessment Empiric methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, intramuscular epinephrine, intravenous C1 esterase inhibitor Berinert(R), and two units of fresh frozen plasma was given in the emergency department. The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit because of mild airway compromise but did not require invasive airway protection. Serum C4 level was normal, ruling out hereditary angioedema. Outcome Patient was discharged after five days in stable condition with resolution of symptoms. Conclusion ACEIs are the most common cause of drug-induced angioedema in the United States. Angioedema is self-limiting swelling that requires close airway monitoring. While health professionals recognize the risk for angioedema with active ACEI use, it is not well known that the risk of angioedema may occur for months following cessation of ACEI therapy. Increased awareness of delayed ACEI-induced angioedema following ACEI discontinuation is important for both providers and pharmacists to provide appropriate diagnosis and monitoring. Improved awareness would also allow patients with a history of ACEI-induced angioedema to be cognizant of the potential for recurrence following drug discontinuation.",2023 Jan 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses recurrent angioedema following the discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses recurrent angioedema following the discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an acquired myopathy of both inflammatory and degenerative nature. CASE REPORT: We present an 81 years old male with a history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) operated 8 years ago and was evaluated for the progressive loss of weight and muscle strength leading to total immobilization in 6 months. He was under imatinib for 8 years despite the remission of GIST. Physical examination disclosed diffuse loss of muscle strength, most prominently involvement of distal upper and proximal lower extremity in an asymmetrical pattern with normal serum creatinine kinase level (CK). Further investigations including bilateral thigh MRI, electromyography (EMG), and PET/CT suggested myositis and degenerative myopathy and ruled out any malignancy. Quadriceps femoris biopsy proved the diagnosis of IBM and no trigger except for imatinib was displayed. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Clinical improvement in terms of weight loss and muscle weakness was achieved after the discontinuation of imatinib. DISCUSSION: This is the first case of IBM associated with prolonged use of imatinib not reported in the literature so far. Since imatinib is widely used in different conditions, it is important to be aware of even its rare adverse effects.

The patient underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using gallium Ga 68 dotatate, which localized the tumors. Selected tumors were treated with 4 doses of 200 mCi of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate during a period of 8 months. At the conclusion of treatment, the patient demonstrated improvement, progressing from bedbound and confused to ambulatory and coherent. In addition, the patient stated he felt no adverse effects. DISCUSSION: Pancreatic NETs are rare tumors affecting 0.001% of the population. These tumors are associated with various symptoms and are classified as functional or nonfunctional. Imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and gallium Ga 68-labeled PET, are essential in detecting and evaluating pancreatic NETs. For patients with localized NETs, the primary treatment is surgery; however, the radiopharmaceuticals yttrium Y 90 microspheres and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate are used as therapy to treat nonresectable tumors. CONCLUSION: Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is used in NET cases that are deemed inoperable and for patients who are not responding to treatment.

Cardiac metastasis from a tongue cancer is a rare finding and only a few cases have been reported previously in the literature. In this case report and literature review, we discuss the main clinical features of patients with cardiac metastases secondary to a tongue cancer and imaging modalities performed, especially the 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). PATIENT CONCERNS: This is a case of a 39-year-old woman who in April 2018 was diagnosed with an invasive well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the movable tongue. She underwent a left hemiglossectomy followed by a revision of hemiglossectomy and ipsilateral selective neck lymph nodes dissection levels II to III because of pathological margins. An early inoperable clinical recurrence was diagnosed and she received radiochemotherapy with good clinical and metabolic response. She remained asymptomatic thereafter. DIAGNOSIS: In January 2020, a pre-scheduled 18F-FDG PET/CT showed a diffuse cardiac involvement. In February 2020, a biopsy of the lesion revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: She was deemed to not be a cardiac surgical candidate and treated by palliative chemotherapy: taxol-carboplatin associated with cetuximab then cetuximab alone because of adverse effects. A re-evaluation imaging performed in April 2020 evidenced a progression of the cardiac involvement, which led to switch chemotherapy by immunotherapy with nivolumab. OUTCOMES: This patient had a very poor prognosis and succumbed to major heart failure 4 months after the diagnosis of cardiac metastasis. CONCLUSION: In this case report, 18F-FDG PET/CT proved to be useful in detecting cardiac metastasis and changed the therapeutic management of the patient. It suggests that patients with tongue malignancies in a context of poor initial prognosis should be followed-up early by 18F-FDG PET/CT with HFLC diet to facilitate detection of recurrence.",2021 Apr 16,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and its metastasis to the heart, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and its metastasis to the heart, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a case of cardiac metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses a case of cardiac metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

This will show that due to widespread PUL connectivity, bilateral PUL RNS may be an option for some individuals with bilateral multifocal epilepsy. METHODS: This study comprises two centers' experience with bilateral PUL RNS for DRE. Patients treated with bilateral PUL RNS at Westchester Medical Center (Valhalla, NY) and Corewell Health (Grand Rapids, MI) between the years 2019 and 2022 were analyzed and described. Presented here are methods for target selection, device programming, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Two patients with Lennox-Gastaut phenotype (aged 13 and 21 years) with posteriorly dominant discharges were implanted with bilateral PUL electrodes. Additionally, two patients (aged 20 and 31 years) with independent left and right occipital bilateral multifocal seizure onsets were implanted with bilateral RNS devices targeting the ipsilateral PUL and ipsilateral occipital cortex. Subclinical and clinical seizures were captured by RNS electrocorticography (ECoG) in all patients. RNS implantation and treatment was well-tolerated without adverse effects in all patients. Relative to baseline, two patients had 25% and 50% reduction in disabling seizures, and two patients had 71% and 100% reduction in disabling seizures. Stimulation paradigms utilized high frequency stimulation in both Lennox-Gastaut phenotype patients. Low frequency (individualized to the terminal ictal frequencies) stimulation was effective in the two bioccipital patients. SIGNIFICANCE: RNS with electrode placement targeting bilateral PUL is safe, and no adverse effects have been attributable to the pulvinar electrode placement. PUL responsive neurostimulation is potentially effective for patients with bilateral multifocal, posteriorly dominant DRE. Both high and low frequency responsive stimulation are treatment options. Longer follow-up will shed light on the ultimate reduction of seizure burden. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: We describe four cases where stimulation devices were placed in the Pulvinar area of the thalamus (central sensory area in the brain). This is very unique and different location than where these devices are typically placed. These patients all had great outcomes with marked seizure reduction, demonstrating that this placement is both safe and effective.",2024 Dec,20241022.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on responsive neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on responsive neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of responsive neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of responsive neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Lymph nodes are the most commonly affected sites, while involvement of the parotid gland is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient with a one-month history of a left parotid mass. The patient has a history of diabetes and long-term smoking, and a chest X-ray revealed secondary fibrotic pulmonary tuberculosis, while sputum smears were culture-negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The parotid mass was surgically removed and subjected to routine HE staining, acid-fast staining, and PCR molecular testing for Mtb. The final diagnosis was Warthin's tumor of the parotid gland with concomitant tuberculosis. One month after removal of the parotid mass, the patient's chest CT showed cavitary tuberculosis. Subsequently, the patient received anti-tuberculosis treatment; however, due to severe gastrointestinal adverse effects, the patient stopped the medication in less than a month and did not receive regular treatment. Four months after stopping the medication, the patient's pulmonary tuberculosis progressed and worsened. CONCLUSION: Combined tuberculosis in Warthin's tumor is extremely rare, with only 14 cases reported to date. However, the specific pathogenesis of this condition is not yet fully understood, and the preliminary treatment and prognosis have not been conclusively determined. Early diagnosis of tuberculosis, standardized and effective use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, and personalized treatment are crucial in the management of tuberculosis. We have reviewed the treatment progress of this rare disease and analyzed the potential pathogenesis of the condition. Furthermore, we have summarized the current understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, drug resistance mechanisms, and the latest treatment advances. These studies have important clinical implications for better understanding and treating extrapulmonary tuberculosis and tuberculosis within Warthin's tumor of the parotid gland.

36800626,PMC9935992,Adverse reactions and efficacy of camrelizumab in patients with lung adenocarcinoma with high PD-L1 expression: A case report.,Wei T||Wang Z||Liu X,"RATIONALE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been rapidly developed for lung cancer therapy and major clinical guidelines have recommended them as the optimal first-line treatment for PD-L1-positive advanced lung cancer. Unfortunately, there is a lack of efficient prediction tools for the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by immunotherapy, and there is a lack of real-world data on the processing of irAEs, particularly those occurring in multiple systems simultaneously. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 62-year-old male with expectoration who was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with brain and bone metastases. DIAGNOSES: The results of the lung cancer tissue biopsy showed lung adenocarcinoma. Gene detection results of lung cancer tissue biopsy showed that the KRAS gene G12D was mutated and PD-L1 was positive, with a tumor proportion score of 95% (Dako 22C3 IHC platform). INTERVENTIONS: The patient initially received 1 cycle of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. After the results of PD-L1 testing were reported, he received 1 cycle of camrelizumab immunotherapy in combination with pemetrexed plus cisplatin based chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: Seventeen days after treatment, the patient presented with symptoms such as yellow staining of the sclera and skin, itching throughout the body, dry mouth, and ecchymosis of the skin of the right lower extremity, which continued to worsen. Following treatment with 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. IrAEs were controlled after dose escalation to 8 mg/kg in combination with plasma exchange therapy and treatment with multiple doses of mycophenolate ester. The patient then received no treatment for almost 2 months, but examination revealed that the tumor still had a persistent shrinkage reaction. LESSONS: Camrelizumab has been well tolerated in several studies, but in patients with high PD-L1 expression and a G12D mutation in KRAS, one should be alert to the development of serious or even multisystem immune-related adverse effects. Timely and individualized selection of the hormone dosage is essential for the treatment of immunotherapy-induced multisystem irAEs.",2023 Feb 17,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on adverse reactions to camrelizumab in lung cancer patients.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on adverse reactions to camrelizumab in lung cancer patients.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses adverse reactions related to immunotherapy in lung cancer patients, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses adverse reactions related to immunotherapy in lung cancer patients, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

It selectively binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 and mediates an antibody-dependent cellular toxicity in various tissues. Trastuzumab use alone does not typically cause aggressive ocular complications. However, herein is a case report of a patient presenting with corneal ulceration in both eyes and perforation in the left eye after 2 months of trastuzumab therapy. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy was consulted for ophthalmic evaluation. She denied any history of ocular conditions and complained of eyelid crusting and sandy sensation in both eyes for 2 weeks. She had been using antibiotic eyedrops for presumed eye infection before her vision deteriorated 3-4 days prior to presentation. A thorough workup for autoimmune and infectious diseases was unyielding. Ophthalmologic examination revealed multiple epithelial defects with ulceration in the right eye and a corneal ulcer with perforation in the left eye. Corneal cultures were negative. Orbital imaging revealed metastases with optic nerve compression. In conjunction with the oncology team, further trastuzumab treatment was deferred. Therapeutic keratoplasty along with ocular surface therapy eventually stabilized both eyes.

34510146,,Case Report: Ipilimumab-induced Multisystem Autoimmune-like Toxicities Suggestive of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like Syndrome.,Monferrer-Adsuara C||Hernandez-Bel L||Hernandez-Garfella ML||Remoli-Sargues L||Ortiz-Salvador M||Castro-Navarro V||Cervera-Taulet E,"SIGNIFICANCE: The emergence of new cancer therapies has dramatically improved outcomes in metastatic melanoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been the most effective treatment. Although, as a direct consequence of the immune dysregulation induced by them, adverse effects termed immune-related adverse events are observed in more than 60% of the patients. PURPOSE: We describe the clinical presentation of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome in a patient with concomitant systemic melanoma treatment with ipilimumab, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 blocker. METHODS: This study aimed to report a case of ipilimumab-induced vitritis, papillitis, and skin and auditory signs suggestive of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma presented with bilateral blurred vision and hearing loss upon completion of three cycles of treatment with ipilimumab. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a bilateral granulomatous uveitis with intense vitritis and papillitis. The result of optical coherence tomography was normal, and fluorescein angiography confirmed the bilateral papillary edema. Ipilimumab was withdrawn, and treatment with oral and systemic steroids led to a rapid improvement in the ophthalmologic and auditory manifestations. Three months after initial presentation, the patient developed vitiligo and poliosis. CONCLUSIONS: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome can develop in the process of immunological deregulation by ipilimumab in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and can correlate temporally with the efficacy of the drug in tumor regression. These observations may help elucidate the underlying mechanism of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome as well as the relation between tumor-associated tolerance and autoimmunity.",2021 Nov 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses adverse effects related to the use of ipilimumab in cancer treatment, specifically autoimmune-like toxicities, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses adverse effects related to the use of ipilimumab in cancer treatment, specifically autoimmune-like toxicities, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

Relapsed extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is associated with a poor prognosis, and there is no established standard of care. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 72 year-old white male with a distant extranasal relapse of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma that has been managed successfully with a combination of radiation and immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab. Pseudoprogression with new skin and bone lesions on positron emission tomography imaging was encountered during this Caucasian patient's immunotherapy and was successfully managed with supportive care and continuation of immune checkpoint blockade. CONCLUSIONS: The patient has been in complete clinical, radiologic, and molecular remission for close to 3 years and has not had any immune-related adverse effects. Pseudoprogression is a clinical challenge that can be encountered while patients are treated with immunotherapy, and astute clinical acumen is needed for accurate management. We believe this is the longest duration of response to immune checkpoint blockade in relapsed extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma reported to date in literature. There is a strong biologic rationale in combining radiation with immunotherapy. The optimal timing, dose, and duration of radiation combined with immunotherapy in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma need to be prospectively evaluated.",2021 Apr 30,20210430.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of relapsed natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and the effects of immune checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of relapsed natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and the effects of immune checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,

Psoriasiform dermatitis is a well-documented adverse effect. CASE REPORT: We present a 68 year-old-male with a 50-year smoking history and a 30-year remote history of plaque psoriasis, limited to the knees and elbows, who presented with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He was started on a chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab. One month later, he presented to dermatology with diffuse erythematous scaly papules coalescing into plaques on 80% of body surface area (BSA). MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Pembrolizumab treatment was paused. The patient was prescribed triamcinolone 0.1% twice daily, but still had significant BSA at one-month and was started on an Il-17 inhibitor, ixekizumab, clearing the psoriasiform dermatitis. He was rechallenged with pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and repeat PET/CT demonstrated excellent tumor response. DISCUSSION: This case prompted a literature review to further characterize the use of IL-17 inhibitors for psoriasiform dermatitis in the setting of ICI therapy. All six cases demonstrated improvement of psoriasiform dermatitis, with two cases showing partial response and four cases showing complete resolution. In three of the six cases, the patients exhibited clinical response to the primary malignancy after rechallenging with ICI, while remaining on an IL-17 inhibitor. Our case, in conjunction with the other reported cases, seems to suggest that IL-17 blockade can maintain a fine balance in this challenging clinical scenario by treating psoriasiform dermatitis without compromising the efficacy of immunotherapy.",2024 Dec,20240807.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the treatment of a drug-induced dermatological condition in a cancer patient.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the treatment of a drug-induced dermatological condition in a cancer patient.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the management of psoriasiform dermatitis induced by PD-1 inhibitors, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the management of psoriasiform dermatitis induced by PD-1 inhibitors, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

One of the microvascular complications of DM is diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), which is associated with increased mortality from serious infections and decreased functional capacity of the patient due to amputation. Uncontrolled diabetes is a significant risk factor for poor wound healing. There is a need for alternative treatments that can promote wound healing in these patients. Several studies have shown the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on wound healing in patients with DFU. LLLT is a potential therapeutic approach in patients with DFU. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old male patient presented with a history of DM, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic foot. The patient had uncontrolled blood sugar levels, with an HbA1C of 9.3%. The patient received therapy in the form of wound care with normal saline, topical antibiotics, and LLLT, with a dose of 10 J/cm(2) with a frequency of therapy 3 times per week. After 12 weeks of therapy, there was improvement, characterized by wound tissue growth and no significant adverse effects during therapy. CONCLUSIONS LLLT can provide benefits in patients with DFU and uncontrolled diabetes. The wound showed improvement after 12 weeks of therapy, and there were no significant adverse effects during therapy.

METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: A 73-year-old Caucasian male patient, with no known medical history, complained of sudden vision loss in his right eye (RE) 18 days following the third dose of Pfizer-BioNTech anti-COVID 19 vaccination. Ten days later, he suffered from sudden vision loss in his left eye (LE).Best-corrected visual acuity was limited to counting fingers at 50cm in both eyes.Fundus examination of both eyes revealed signs of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with diffuse superficial and deep retinal hemorrhages in all four quadrants. Diagnosis was confirmed of fluorescein angiography.Optical coherent tomography (OCT) showed an ischemic hyperreflectivity and disorganization of the inner retinal layers in both eyes with significantly increased central macular thickness, associated to intraretinal fluid accumulation in LE.An urgent systemic assessment was requested. A mild hypertension was discovered and the rest of the work up was unremarkable. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we report the first case of bilateral CRVO in a healthy patient after anti-COVID 19 vaccination. CRVO occurred few days following third shot of vaccine followed by a sequential CRVO in the fellow eye in a patient with recently diagnosed very mild hypertension and no thrombo-embolic risk factors, strongly suggesting a relationship between both events.

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, have known mortality benefit in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, but data are limited regarding safety. Attributable to the immunomodulatory nature of this medication, patients may be at risk for opportunistic infections, including chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CPPA), a slowly progressive disease characterized pulmonary infiltrates and often a newly-formed cavity. However, current guidelines do not emphasize post-treatment surveillance of patients for opportunistic infections, including CPPA. CASE REPORT We present a particular case of a 64-year-old man treated for COVID-19 pneumonia with Tocilizumab and dexamethasone who developed cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis. He presented to the emergency department with hemoptysis, associated with worsening productive cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed areas of focal consolidation and a cavitary lung lesion within the left upper lobe. Sputum culture was positive for Aspergillus niger. The patient received a long course of oral triazole therapy for CPPA, with clinical improvement. CT scan of the chest at 9 months showed that the Itraconazole therapy was effective in resolving the extensive airspace disease and decreasing the size of the upper-lobe cavity and fungal ball. CONCLUSIONS This article illustrates the possibility of a serious infection such as CCPA as an adverse effect of Tocilizumab treatment, especially with concurrent immunosuppressive therapy.

SUMMARY: An 85-year-old woman receiving monthly fulvestrant injections in the outpatient setting developed a necrotic lesion at the fulvestrant injection site on her right buttock. Her medical history is notable for metastatic breast cancer with bone metastases. Prior to developing the necrotic lesion, the patient was receiving monthly fulvestrant injections for 6 years. Other potential causes such as infection and pressure necrosis were ruled out clinically. After 185 days of wound care involving multiple surgical debridements, topical therapy, and frequent follow-up appointments, the patient's wound resolved with 100% epithelialization. Nicolau syndrome has been reported with other non-vesicant, injectable medications such as antibiotics and corticosteroids; however, it has not been previously reported with fulvestrant. CONCLUSION: Nicolau syndrome developed in the right buttock of a patient with metastatic breast cancer following an intramuscular fulvestrant injection. Healthcare practitioners need to be cognizant of this adverse effect with intramuscular injections in order to recognize and refer patients for wound care evaluation early in the evolution of this syndrome. Proper injection technique is recommended to reduce the risk of this idiopathic adverse effect.",2022 Dec,20210429.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a specific case of Nicolau syndrome related to fulvestrant injections, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a specific case of Nicolau syndrome related to fulvestrant injections, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.",2,90,,
39217317,PMC11365228,The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection.,Mena S||Raj A||Caldwell W||Kaushal A,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical epidural steroid injections (ESIs) can provide effective pain management for patients suffering from chronic neck pain due to various pathological changes of the cervical spine. There are several rare adverse effects reported from interventional pain procedures, including persistent hiccups (""singultus""). Based on a limited number of cases, we propose a modified treatment algorithm for this adverse outcome (Fig. 3). CASE REPORT: Singultus has been documented as an adverse effect of interventional pain procedures, including epidural steroid, facet joint, and sacroiliac joint injections. We describe the case of a general contractor who presented to our clinic with chronic neck pain and central canal stenosis. The patient received an uncomplicated lumbar ESI in the past and was recommended for a cervical interlaminar ESI. After an uneventful C6-C7 interlaminar ESI with dexamethasone, 1% lidocaine, and normal saline the patient developed singultus. Baclofen was sent to his pharmacy, but this was unsuccessful at alleviating his hiccups. The patient was subsequently started on chlorpromazine and found relief from his symptomatology. CONCLUSION: Persistent hiccups after ESI or interventional pain procedures can be treated with conservative measures and non-pharmacologic methods, with escalation to therapy with baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, other antipsychotic or antidopaminergic agents, and possible dual or triple therapy if further indicated.",2024 Aug 31,20240831.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Uveitis has been described as an adverse effect related to this medication. Although several case reports have been published describing uveitis and bilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome related to moxifloxacin, we present a unique case of a patient with severe sequelae associated with bilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome secondary to the use of oral moxifloxacin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old Colombian hispanic female presented bilateral conjunctival hyperemia, decreased visual acuity, blurred vision, photophobia, and ocular pain after 15 days of treatment with systemic moxifloxacin for an upper tract respiratory infection. The patient presented unilateral anterior chamber pigment dispersion, mydriatic and nonreactive pupils, extensive iris transillumination defects, and secondary glaucoma. Blood and aqueous humor tests were negative for infectious and autoimmune diseases. Moxifloxacin-induced bilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome was diagnosed. Permanent sequelae such as ocular pain, photophobia, and focus difficulty secondary to severe bilateral iridian atrophy and inability of synkinetic reflex were left. Additionally, glaucoma was diagnosed, and Ahmed valve implantation was required. CONCLUSIONS: We should be aware of the possible association between moxifloxacin and bilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome.

36239562,,Integration of Complementary Medicine for Multilocal Chronic Pain: Treatment Results From the Patient Perspective.,Romeyke T,"CONTEXT: Chronic pain affects individuals' quality of life, physical functionality, and psychological well-being. In the case of multifactorial diseases with an increasing tendency to become chronic, individual therapies often can't alleviate symptoms. The integration of recognized naturopathic methods into a variety of therapies could increase their success. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to assess the benefits of integration of recognized naturopathic therapy methods into acute care as an option that provides holistic, patient-centered treatment. DESIGN: The author performed a case study. SETTING: The study took place at Waldhausklinik-Acute Hospital for Internal Medicine, Pain Therapy, Complementary and Individualized Patient-centered Medicine in Deuringen, Germany. PARTICIPANT: The participant was a 40-year-old female patient who had been admitted to the hospital for inpatient treatment, with acutely exacerbated, multilocular pain with advanced chronification in combination with concomitant pain-creating, sustained psychological illness. INTERVENTION: In addition to conventional medical therapy, the participant received a complex, naturopathic treatment under operation and procedure key 8-975 (The German procedure classification (Operationen- und Prozedurenschlussel - OPS) is the official classification for the encoding of operations, procedures and general medical measures) with high density. The medical team used physical and physiotherapeutic units, drainage therapies, relaxation methods, behavior therapy, mind-body therapy, exercise therapy, hydro- and thermotherapy, and acupuncture. OUTCOMES MEASURES: The study used the following outcome measures: (1) a VAS for pain, (2) an assessment of physical symptoms according to Zerssen, (3) the Pain Disability Index (PDI), (4) the Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire (FFbH), (5) the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D), and (6) adverse effects. RESULTS: The participant's pain significantly decreased, and she slowly achieved mobility: (1) her pain score on the VAS decreased from 9.3/10 to 4/10; (2) her complaints list decreased from 28 points to 8 points; (3) her score on the PDI decreased from 59.8 points to 15.2 points; (4) her score on the FFbH increased from 55% to 66%; (5) her score on the PHQ-D decreased from 25 points to 2 points; (6) she experienced no adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The complex naturopathic treatment is a procedure that can lead to positive therapy results, especially in the case of serious chronic illnesses that are accompanied by acute flare-ups. In the case of progression of severe chronic pain, medical practitioners should consider a multimodal therapy with the integration of naturopathic methods. In the past, the assessment of individual complementary techniques for individual clinical pictures has predominated. The aim of further research should be the use of several methods as multimodal therapies to meet the needs of patients with complex clinical pictures.",2023 Oct,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the integration of complementary medicine for chronic pain management and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}",The article discusses the integration of complementary medicine for chronic pain management and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,95,,

As per the manufacturer, apixaban offers a dose reduction when administered concurrently with ritonavir; thus, we explore the clinical indication and safety of apixaban when given with ritonavir-boosted highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in an HIV patient. Summary: We describe a 73-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, including a past medical history of resolved left ventricular thrombus, newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, and HIV infection treated with ritonavir-boosted HAART. The patient presented to the emergency department with bleeding from multiple sites, necessitating the use of vitamin K. Consequently, his hospital course was complicated by episodes of minor bleeding and labile INR. Due to the complicated nature of his condition and the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs), he was transitioned from warfarin to apixaban. Since there is little readily available data to support the use of rivaroxaban and dabigatran with ritonavir, our patient was safely started on dose-reduced apixaban for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation due to the predictable nature of apixaban pharmacokinetics and proven superiority regarding adverse effects, as compared to other DOACs.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is treatable, and the management consists of potassium correction, beta-blockers, and antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy. While TPP is well described in the literature, we describe a case of TPP with urticarial dermographia (UD) that resolved with a short course of antihistamines while continuing ATD therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of UD after methimazole (MMI) therapy in a TPP patient.

33074091,,Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in a child with a liver transplant: A case report.,Lu X||Chen L||Qi F||Zhang B||Liu Y||Zhu L,"OBJECTIVE: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia is rarely reported in liver transplant patients, especially in children. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 7-month-old liver-transplanted child who suffered from thrombocytopenia induced by linezolid. We simulated the pharmacokinetics of linezolid in a healthy adult using the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and found that the liver is the most abundant organ for the distribution of linezolid. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Linezolid has a high distribution in the liver. As a result, an increased awareness about the risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia should be strengthened in patients with liver injury. Effects of ethnicity: The differences between Chinese patients and patients of other ethnicities may lead to the diverse effects of linezolid in different patients. The influence of body weight (BW) difference in pharmacokinetics (PK) of linezolid between Asian (Chinese and Japanese) and Caucasians was demonstrated in several population PK studies [1, 2, 3]. The average BW of Asians is lower than that of the Caucasian population, the clearance and apparent volume of distribution are lower than in the European population, and C(max) is higher than in the Western population. Therefore, the adverse effects of linezolid at the same dose may increase in Chinese patients.",2021 Feb,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in a liver transplant patient.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in a liver transplant patient.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in a child with a liver transplant, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in a child with a liver transplant, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,
37817675,,Camrelizumab-induced oral lichenoid reaction with subepithelial CD4+ T-cell infiltration.,Wang X||Fu T||Sun W,"INTRODUCTION: Camrelizumab is a novel anti-programed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody that has been investigated for the treatment of various malignancies. Increasing immune-related adverse events have been reported in clinical practice, with CD4+ T-cell-mediated-reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation being the most common. Camrelizumab-induced oral lichenoid reaction (OLR) appears to be a rare adverse effect compared with other anti-PD therapies induced OLR, with the main pathogenesis of activated CD8+ T cells mediating autoimmune reactions. Herein, we report a rare case of camrelizumab-induced OLR and a possible pathogenic mechanism of subepithelial CD4+ T-cell infiltration. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma three years prior, presented with a two-month history of oral erosion that developed while under camrelizumab therapy. Diffuse erythematous and erosive lesions surrounded by bilateral white lesions on the buccal mucosa were detected in his physical examination. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the lesions revealed the presence of basal keratinocyte degeneration and band-like subepithelial T-cell infiltration. The immunostaining for CD4 on T-cell was positive, while CD8 were sporadically positive. Flow cytometry showed a gradual increase in the CD4+ T-cell proportion in the peripheral blood, with the CD8+ T-cell percentage almost unchanged and in the normal range. We obtained a score of 6 based on the Naranjo algorithm, which means a probable adverse drug reaction. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient exhibited notable improvement after two weeks of treatment with topical glucocorticoid without regulating his immunotherapy, and remained in stable condition in the follow-up. DISCUSSION: This case may offer new insight to clinicians on the pathogenesis of anti-PD-1-induced OLR. More critically, it may provide some ideas for a more precise anti-PD therapy or corresponding combination therapy for patients becoming resistant to immunotherapy due to exhausted CD4+ T-cell responses in the tumor microenvironment.",2024 Jan,20231011.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses an adverse effect related to camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses an adverse effect related to camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.",2,90,,
38448889,PMC10919028,Severe megaloblastic anemia in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma during treatment with erlotinib: a case report and literature review.,Yan X||Kong J||Wang J||Wang C||Shen H,"BACKGROUND: Erlotinib is a first-generation, tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKI) used for the treatment patients with NSCLC. Erlotinib is considered as a safe and effective treatment option, with generally good tolerance. Diarrhea and rash are the most common side effects, and more rare side effects appear in long-term real-world applications. Severe erlotinib related megaloblastic anemia is rare and remains unreported. This is the first case report of severe megaloblastic anemia in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with an EGFR L858R mutation treated with erlotinib. In this report, the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of erlotinib related severe megaloblastic anemia are described, and the possible pathogenesis and related treatment options are discussed. CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we present a 57- year-old non-smoking female diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR L858R mutation, who had received erlotinib as the first-line therapy. After 44 weeks of treatment, the patient developed severe anemia. Anemia was manifested as megaloblastic anemia with elevated mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. The total vitamin B12 level was below the detection limit of 50.00 pg /mL. Bone marrow smear suggested megaloblastic anemia. Her hematologic parameters were markedly recovered following the withdrawal of erlotinib and vitamin B12 supplement. As a result, the patient was diagnosed with erlotinib-associated megaloblastic anemia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of severe megaloblastic anemia reported with erlotinib. Few of these hematologic adverse effects have been observed in studies on erlotinib, this case report highlights this possibility for long-term erlotinib administration.

Common adverse effects associated with 5-ASA include gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, and skin rashes. Perimyocarditis induced by 5-ASA is a rare adverse effect, with only a limited number of cases reported. This paper presents a case of 5-ASA-induced perimyocarditis in a 29-year-old female who had been taking 5-ASA for three weeks. The patient was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea, chest discomfort, and fever. She subsequently underwent laboratory investigations, including electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, chest computed tomographic angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and heart biopsy. Intravenous steroid was administered, and 5-ASA was discontinued. The patient's signs and symptoms improved significantly within a few days of discontinuing 5-ASA, leading to her subsequent discharge. This case highlights the importance of considering perimyocarditis in patients exhibiting cardiac symptoms during 5-ASA therapy, despite it being a rare adverse effect.

Some unexpected adverse effects such as the development of systemic hyper inflammation with multiorgan involvement after vaccination, in rare cases, have been reported. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear. METHODS: This study recruited two cases who suffered from systemic inflammation following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and two 30-year-old male volunteers without underlying disease who have received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine as control group. Blood samples were collected from our patients and healthy subjects before and after treatment with anti-inflammatory agent such as glucocorticoid and tocilizumab. The immune profile from our patients and healthy controls were measured using a human XL cytokine Proteome Profiler array (ARY022b, R&D Systems). RESULTS: Biochemical parameters revealed leukocytosis with segmented neutrophil dominance and elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin in these two patients. The cytokine array revealed that mean levels of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) (3640.3 vs 1580.5 pixels per inch [ppi]), B-cell activating factor (BAFF) (3036.8 vs 1471.0 ppi), urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (uPAR) (1043.1 vs 516.8 ppi), Resistin (1783.7 vs 711.3 ppi), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB/BB (1980.7 vs 939.7 ppi), macrophage inflammatory protein-3-beta (MIP-3beta) (911.9 vs 346.2 ppi), and interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) (1026.3 vs 419.7 ppi) were 2-fold higher in the patients than in normal subjects who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.

We describe how a 50-year-old man diagnosed with advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) developed severe PHPT after receiving the programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor camrelizumab. The patient eventually died of respiratory failure and a progressive malignancy. We speculate that the hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia observed in this case were secondary to ICI-induced PHPT.

34477161,PMC8415952,Airway management during left-sided gastrobronchial fistula repair after esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma: A case report.,Wang SY||Yuan WC||Wu EB,"RATIONALE: Gastrobronchial fistula (GBF) is a rare but life-threatening complication of esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction, and airway management during fistula repair is challenging. Here, we describe airway management in a patient undergoing left-sided GBF repair using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 63-year-old man diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma underwent esophagectomy with reconstruction by gastric pull-up and tabularization of the gastric conduit. Subsequently, about 8 weeks later, the patient presented with repeated pneumonia and a 1-week history of cough with significant sputum, dysphagia, and repeated fever. DIAGNOSIS: GBF, a rare postoperative complication, was located on the left main bronchus at 2 cm below the carina and was diagnosed based on findings from gastroscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, and thoracic computed tomography scan with contrast. INTERVENTIONS: We performed left-sided one-lung ventilation (OLV) under total intravenous anesthesia instead of inhalational anesthetics. The left-sided OLV, with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and nasogastric tube decompression, generated positive pressure across the fistula. It prevented backflow into the left main bronchus. Total intravenous anesthesia preserved hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and prevented adverse effects associated with inhalational anesthetics. A right-sided, double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted after anesthesia induction, and surgical repair was performed through a right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. OUTCOMES: Intraoperative hemodynamics remained relatively stable, except for brief tachycardia at 113 beats/min. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.17 and PaO2 89.1 mmHg upon 100% oxygenation, along with hypercapnia (PaCO2 77.1 mmHg), indicating respiratory acidosis. During OLV, pulse oximetry remained higher than 92%. The defect in the left main bronchus was successfully sutured after dissecting the fistula between the left main bronchus and the gastric conduit, and subsequently, OLV resulted in ideal ventilation. LESSONS: A left-sided GBF could lead to leakage from the OLV during surgery. Possible aspiration or alveolar hypoventilation due to this leakage is a major concern during airway management before surgical repair of the main bronchus.",2021 Sep 3,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on airway management during gastrobronchial fistula repair, a surgical issue unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on airway management during gastrobronchial fistula repair, a surgical issue unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses airway management during a surgical procedure related to a gastrobronchial fistula, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses airway management during a surgical procedure related to a gastrobronchial fistula, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Approximately 80% of SSc patients develop both gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and dysphagia. The nocturnal GERD can cause regurgitation and aspiration, which can further aggravate the pulmonary fibrosis from SSc. Also, their dysphagia is further worsened by performing standard Nissen fundoplication. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether Dor fundoplication (a 180 degrees  anterior wrap) can reduce nocturnal heartburn and regurgitation without worsening dysphagia in patients with SSc and severe GERD. Five SSc patients with drug-refractory severe GERD underwent a Dor fundoplication procedure with a median follow-up of 2 years (range: 1-5 years). In all 5 patients, the preoperative high-resolution manometry showed significant impairment of esophageal motility. Patients were interviewed postoperatively to assess for nocturnal and diurnal GERD symptoms, treatment response, the status of dysphagia, and adverse effects of surgery. The average age of 5 patients was 50 years and all were females. Four of the 5 patients (80%) reported 90% improvement in both diurnal and nocturnal GERD symptoms since surgery, with no nocturnal reflux, heartburn, or regurgitation, and reports to sleep at night without requiring any more pillows or wedges. About 50% of patients reported a decrease in their proton pump inhibitor dosage after surgery compared to before surgery.

Four days after receiving the vaccine, the women presented to her primary care physician with malaise, fever and recurrent epistaxis. Clinical examination revealed oral petechiae, ecchymoses, and non-palpable petechiae on both legs. The patient was immediately referred to a local hematology unit where she developed hematuria and an intestinal bleeding (WHO Bleeding Grade III) requiring multiple transfusions. After receiving oral corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins, her platelets gradually recovered. Common causes of secondary ITP were ruled out by laboratory investigations, bone marrow and peripheral blood examinations. This raises the possibility of a (secondary) vaccination-associated thrombocytopenia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of a DTaP-IP vaccination-related ITP in an adult patient in the English literature. CONCLUSION: Although a causal connection between both entities may not be established, we would like to raise awareness in clinicians that ITP following DTaP-IP vaccinations is potentially not limited to children, but may also occur in adults. Users of DTaP-IP booster vaccines should be alert of the possibility of such adverse reactions.",2022 May 3,20220503.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it discusses a case of thrombocytopenia following a DTaP-IP vaccination.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it discusses a case of thrombocytopenia following a DTaP-IP vaccination.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of immune thrombocytopenia following DTaP-IP vaccination, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of immune thrombocytopenia following DTaP-IP vaccination, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines.",2,90,,

It is characterised by necrotising vasculitis with multiorgan eosinophilic infiltration. Pulmonary manifestations are the most common presentation of EGPA, and cardiac complications are the most common cause of death. Anaesthetic management of EGPA is challenging due to perioperative pulmonary complications, multiorgan involvement and greater risk of cholinesterase enzyme deficiency. We are reporting the anaesthetic management of a 58-year-old woman, diagnosed with EGPA 3 years ago, who underwent urgent intramedullary nail insertion for a femur fracture. The anaesthetic technique comprised femoral nerve block and spinal anaesthesia, thereby avoiding (1) the need for upper airway manipulation, (2) potential adverse effects of anticholinesterase drugs (for reversal of neuromuscular blockade) and (3) histamine release associated with morphine administration perioperatively.

As such, their adverse effects have yet to be fully understood, with only recent literature documenting autoimmune phenomena secondary to their utilization. Specific immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been linked with the development of myasthenia gravis, which is classically known to manifest spontaneously in patients. Given the relative rarity of this presentation, the risk of misdiagnosis and subsequent mortality and morbidity is concerning. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss the case of a 73-year-old male who presented with clinical symptoms of myasthenia gravis and myositis shortly after beginning treatment with Pembrolizumab. The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was initially missed at an outside hospital, which delayed initiation of proper treatment. CONCLUSION: While the incidence of ""de-novo"" diseases secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitors might be increasing, guidelines regarding best treatment options do not yet exist, leaving many providers at a loss when faced with making clinical decisions surrounding patients with De novo myasthenia gravis.

Severe headaches as a side effect of blood transfusion in patients with thalassemia are not commonly observed, especially when combined with superficial siderosis of the central nervous system, which is easily misdiagnosed and requires excessive examination and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old woman was admitted with severe headache and vomiting over 3 days following blood transfusion. She was diagnosed with intermediate alpha-thalassemia at 2 years of age and had a history of irregular blood transfusions. Physical examination revealed horizontal nystagmus with no other abnormal neurological signs. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR venography, MR arteriography, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. However, susceptibility-weighted imaging showed abnormal signals in the bilateral and fourth ventricles. Initial antibiotics, antivirals, decompression of intracranial pressure, iron chelation, and symptomatic treatments were administered; subsequently, small intermittent blood transfusions were cautiously administered for severe anemia. The patient's headache was gradually relieved, and she was discharged on day 9. At the 5-month follow-up, the patient's headache recurred following another transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Severe post-transfusion headache in patients with thalassemia has not been fully recognized and is easily misdiagnosed, leading to excessive examination and treatment.

Papilledema can occur because of increased intracranial pressure caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the incidence of which may be more likely in patients with a history of COVID-19 because of an induced hypercoagulable state. PURPOSE: This case report presents a case of papilledema secondary to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a patient with a recent history of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old man hospitalized with a complicated course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was referred to the ophthalmology department for episodic blurry vision of both eyes and intermittent binocular diplopia. Clinical examination revealed diffuse bilateral optic disc edema. Magnetic resonance venography of the brain during his admission revealed subtotal occlusion of the right transverse sinus by thrombosis. At the time of diagnosis, the patient was already taking systemic anticoagulation therapy for treatment of a recent pulmonary embolism also thought to be induced by COVID-19. After additional treatment with acetazolamide, there was improvement in his optic nerve edema. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, can occur as a rare complication of COVID-19.

34388145,PMC8370136,Intussusception and Chronic Marijuana Use in a Young Adult.,Silva V||Khalil K||Zaidi SR||Highsmith S||Tucker JI,"BACKGROUND Intussusception is a common phenomenon in children, but it is rare in adults. In the pediatric population, the presentation is commonly primary, without a lead point. However, up to 90% of intussusception cases arise due to a secondary cause - a pathological lead point - which the most common etiology in adults being malignancy. Herein, we present a case report of adult intussusception without a known cause. CASE REPORT A 26-year-old woman presented to the hospital with severe abdominal pain. She admitted to not passing stool or gas for 2 days. The patient's social history was significant for chronic marijuana use. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 6-cm in length intussuscepted segment of bowel in the descending colon distal to the splenic flexure with no obvious inciting mass. The patient was sent for emergent open abdominal surgery. Upon surgical exploration, the surgeons discovered that the intussusception had self-resolved. Aside from a small ball of stool, an intraoperative colonoscopy revealed no masses or polyps. CONCLUSIONS Marijuana use is known to disrupt gastrointestinal (GI) mobility through receptors in the GI tract nerve plexuses. The incidence of chronic marijuana use and adult intussusception is documented in the literature. Conservative management with bowel rest is confirmed to be a suitable treatment option with a favorable outcome.

39434379,PMC11514521,Splenic Rupture Following Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy: A Case Requiring Emergency Splenectomy.,Chakarov D||Hadzhiev D||Hadzhieva E,"BACKGROUND Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a common procedure, and splenic rupture is a rare complication of ESWL. Depending on the stage of injury and patient's condition, treatment options include non-operative management (NOM) and emergency splenectomy. Diagnosis is not difficult with symptoms such as deteriorating hemodynamic and hematologic indices, localized physical signs of peritoneal irritation in the left hypochondriac region, and confirmation provided by signs of free fluid (hemoperitoneum) seen on ultrasound or computed tomography (CT). Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient survival. If NOM is not feasible, emergency laparotomy with splenectomy is standard procedure. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man with a medical history of arterial hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia was emergently admitted 1 day after undergoing ESWL for bilateral nephrolithiasis. He presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anemia. Urgent CT confirmed a splenic rupture, with intraperitoneal fluid. He underwent emergency splenectomy 24 h after ESWL. Complete splenic rupture (grade IV) was identified, accompanied by significant blood loss of 2000 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 7, with primary wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Splenic injury following ESWL is a rare but serious complication. Our case underscores the importance of monitoring for splenic injury following ESWL. Management should be multidisciplinary, considering physiological, anatomical, and immunological aspects. While splenectomy is the standard treatment, NOM can be considered for hemodynamically stable patients to avoid complications following splenectomy.

Generally, lifestyle interventions alone for the treatment of obesity have modest long-term effectiveness. Phentermine-topiramate extended release is a relatively new medication approved for weight reduction. Sleep-related eating disorder is a rare condition that is often underdiagnosed. Both conditions are chronic and require long-term management. There is no definitive treatment for sleep-related eating disorder, and therapeutic options are based on case reports. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Caucasian male with a body mass index of 41.7 kg/m(2) presented for obesity treatment. History revealed nocturnal episodes of hyperphagia associated with amnesia of overeating and other features of sleep-related eating disorder. Treatment was initiated with phentermine-topiramate extended release. Five months later he lost 5% of his body weight and demonstrated resolution of sleep-related eating disorder behaviors. He reported no adverse side effects. Upon self-discontinuation of the medication, his eating disorder recurred. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians intending to help patients reduce body weight should screen for nocturnal eating and other eating disorders. Sleep-related eating disorder can be associated with significant morbidity and excess weight. Patients report adverse effects on quality of life as a result.

33861632,,Transfer of the Serotonin Modulator Vortioxetine into Human Milk: A Case Series.,Marshall K||Datta P||Rewers-Felkins K||Krutsch K||Baker T||Hale TW,"Background: Vortioxetine (Trintellix) is a serotonin modulator used in the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. There are no data presently published on the transfer of vortioxetine into human breast milk. Case Report: The present study determined the drug concentration-time profile of vortioxetine in milk samples collected from three lactating mothers, two consuming 10 mg once daily and one consuming 20 mg once daily. Milk levels were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. At a dose of 10 mg/day, the maximum concentration of vortioxetine in milk was 13.89 ng/mL. At a dose of 20 mg/day, the maximum concentration in milk was 52.32 ng/mL. The relative infant dose was calculated to be 1.1% for 10 mg dose and 1.7% for 20 mg dose. Conclusion: In these three cases, we found the levels of vortioxetine in breast milk to be low and dose proportional. However, both RID's for 10 and 20 mg doses (1.1% and 1.7%, respectively) fall below the 10% theoretical level of concern and no adverse effects were reported by the mothers.

While a single course of systemic corticosteroids may be sufficient for many irAEs, no clear standard-of-care guidelines exist for steroid-refractory cases. We present an unusual case of a patient who developed several steroid-refractory novel irAEs on pembrolizumab despite ongoing B cell-directed immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab, who ultimately noted resolution of symptoms with tacrolimus, a T-cell-directed immunosuppressant. CASE PRESENTATION: This 72-year-old Caucasian man with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-associated neuropathy was being treated with maintenance rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin when he was started on pembrolizumab (2.26 mg/kg) for metastatic urothelial cancer 31 months after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. After his third dose of pembrolizumab, he developed a painful blistering papular rash of the distal extremities. He received two more doses of pembrolizumab before he also developed diarrhea, and it was held; he was initiated on 1 mg/kg prednisone for presumed ICI-induced dermatitis and colitis. Skin biopsy 10 weeks after cessation of pembrolizumab and taper of steroids to 20  mg daily revealed a unique bullous erythema multiforme. He was then admitted with dyspnea and imaging concerning for necrotizing pneumonia, but did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Bronchoscopy and biopsy revealed acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia. His symptoms failed to fully respond to multiple courses of high-dose systemic corticosteroids and a trial of azathioprine, but pneumonia, diarrhea, and skin rash all improved markedly with tacrolimus. The patient has since completed his therapy for tacrolimus, continues off of ICI, and has not experienced a recurrence of any irAEs, though has more recently experienced progression of his cancer. CONCLUSION: Despite immunosuppression with rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin, two immunomodulators targeting B cells, ICI cessation, and systemic corticosteroid therapy, our patient developed two high-grade unusual irAEs, bullous erythema multiforme and acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia.

Many studies indicate CS might extend the survival of patients with initially unresectable LA PDAC. However, several clinical questions concerning CS remain, such as the optimal preoperative treatment. Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is a unique radiotherapy that offers higher biological effectiveness than conventional radiotherapy. Here, we report a long-term survival case with initially unresectable LA PDAC who underwent CS after chemotherapy followed by CIRT. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 72-year-old Japanese woman with unresectable LA pancreatic head cancer with tumor contact to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). She underwent four courses of chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel). However, the lesion did not shrink and tumor contact with the SMA did not improve after chemotherapy. Because the probability of achieving curative resection was judged to be low, she underwent radical dose CIRT, and chemotherapy was continued. She complained of vomiting 2 months after CIRT. Although imaging studies showed no tumor growth or metastasis, a duodenal obstruction which was speculated to be an adverse effect of CIRT was observed. She could not eat solid food and a trans-nasal feeding tube was inserted. Therapeutic intervention was required to enable enteral nutrition. We proposed several treatment options. She chose resection with the expectation of an anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy and CIRT rather than course observation with tube feeding or bypass surgery.

Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that improves cognition by preventing postsynaptic degradation of hippocampal acetylcholine in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia. Donepezil has been attributed to some adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal symptoms. However, cardiovascular adverse effects are not common as there remains a dearth of literature regarding donepezil-induced bradycardia. CASE REPORT: Hence, we present the case of a 70-year-old Hispanic female with past psychiatry history of schizophrenia who developed bradycardia and syncope following the commencement of low-dose donepezil in the inpatient unit and subsequent resolution with cessation. She had no prior cardiovascular symptoms or diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Considering there is no baseline cardiac monitoring requirement guideline for patients on Donepezil treatment, pre-assessment electrocardiogram is advised before the commencement of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Finally, routine monitoring of vital signs for at least the first 72 hours following the start of donepezil might be good proactive practice for all psychiatrists.

37000076,PMC10063274,Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment of Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer: A case report.,An G||He XC||Bai J||Wang J,"RATIONALE: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies globally, and its occurrence and development are associated with genetic, dietary, biological, and immune factors. Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC), as a special subtype of GC, has become a research hotspot in recent years. In patients with advanced GC, Epstein-Barr virus infection is closely related to lymph node metastasis, depth of tumor invasion, and poor prognosis. There is great clinical need for a new treatment modality for EBVaGC. Advances in molecular biology and cancer genetics have led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); patients treated with ICIs experience clinical benefit and few adverse effects. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: We report a 31-year-old male with advanced EBVaGC and multiple sites of lymph node metastasis who was intolerant to multiple lines of chemotherapy. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: After immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, both primary and metastatic tumors shrank significantly without noticeable adverse reactions. After 21 months of progression-free status, the patient underwent R0 resection. LESSONS: This case report provides evidence for the use of ICIs in treating EBVaGC. It also shows that detection of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small nuclear RNA may be a prognostic factor in gastric cancer.",2023 Mar 31,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the treatment of gastric cancer and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the treatment of gastric cancer and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in treating Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in treating Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

While its efficacy in improving symptoms has been studied, its effect on colonic motor function remains unclear. This case series explores SNS's impact on colonic motor function in pediatric patients with idiopathic constipation, using high-resolution colonic manometry (HRCM). METHODS: Four pediatric patients with chronic idiopathic constipation underwent SNS placement for intractable symptoms and were subsequently evaluated via HRCM. Clinical characteristics, comorbidities, treatment regimens, and outcomes were reviewed. HRCM was conducted during the SNS-off and SNS-on phases. The motility index (MI) was measured during the SNS-off (fasting and postprandial) and SNS-on phases. RESULTS: Four pediatric patients aged 8 to 21 years met the inclusion criteria. In three patients, SNS-induced high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) were noted, and in one patient, low-amplitude propagating contractions (LAPCs) were noted. In one patient, propagating contractions were induced only when SNS was turned on. MI changes with SNS-on were variable among different patients with an increase in MI in two patients after turning SNS on and a decrease in the other two compared with baseline. Adverse effects following SNS placement remained minimal across all cases. CONCLUSION: This case series is the first to report SNS effects on colonic motility evaluated by HRCM in pediatrics. We demonstrate that propagating colonic contractions are promptly induced when SNS is turned on. Although the initial effects of SNS on colonic motility were observable, additional investigation is necessary to comprehend the fundamental mechanisms and long-term effectiveness of SNS in pediatric patients.",2024 Jul 1,20240315.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses sacral nerve stimulation and its effects on colonic motility in pediatric patients, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses sacral nerve stimulation and its effects on colonic motility in pediatric patients, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

But what to do when all these treatments fail? We report a case of remission from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook (TwHF) treatment. METHODS: The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral prednisone, minocycline, bisphosphonate injection, etanercept, and tofacitinib, but the symptoms did not change significantly. Treatment with TwHF (1.0 mg/kg/day, patient weight 60 kg) was started for 24 weeks. RESULTS: After 50 months of unsatisfactory treatment, this patient was finally treated with herbal TwHF, and after 6 months of treatment, the patient's magnetic resonance imaging and inflammatory indexes were significantly improved, indicating that the disease had been better controlled. CONCLUSION: In this study, TwHF was successful in treating a patient with refractory SAPHO syndrome who was refractory to multiple Western medications without significant adverse effects or toxicities, but further follow-up is needed to determine long-term efficacy.

Trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare adverse effect. There have been no reports of acute, grade 4 thrombocytopenia after weekly trastuzumab therapy. The study reports a case of a breast cancer patient with severe thrombocytopenia due to trastuzumab infusion (8 mg/kg). Moreover, the patient experienced recurrence of severe thrombocytopenia after receiving weekly trastuzumab therapy (4 mg/kg). CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old woman with HER-2-positive breast cancer developed diffuse petechial haemorrhages and ecchymosis on the lower limbs and gingival bleeding within 24 hours of trastuzumab infusion (8 mg/kg). She was confirmed to have severe thrombocytopenia, which quickly recovered after corticosteroid therapy and platelet transfusion. When her platelet count recovered, we attempted weekly trastuzumab therapy (4 mg/kg); however, thrombocytopenia recurred within 24 hours. Thus, we did not attempt further treatment with trastuzumab. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: We are the first to attempt weekly trastuzumab therapy after thrombocytopenia induced by its initial administration.

The most frequent complications associated with this type of treatment are mild and are located at the thyroid, pulmonary or hepatic level. Sarcoid like reaction and mesenteric panniculitis secondary to pembrolizumab treatment are two very rare adverse effects. We present the case of a patient with these complications. Purpose: the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer has undergone a major change in the last 10 years, largely due to the advent of immunotherapy. Anti PD1 agents such as pembrolizumab have increased the median survival of these patients from 13 to 26 months. Most frequent immunorelated side effects are hypothyroidism, pneumonitis or elevated liver enzymes. However, there are other adverse effects, including sarcoid-like reaction and mesenteric panniculitis, which should be known by the professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of this type of patient. We present the case of a 62-year-old man with a history of unresectable and non-irradiable stage IIIB epidermoid lung carcinoma with a PD-L1 expression of 30% in whom pembrolizumab was discontinued after 4 cycles due to immunorelated arthritis. One year later he consulted for severe abdominal pain. A PET-CT scan was performed, showing hilar lymphadenopathy and inflammation of abdominal mesenteric fat. A biopsy of lesions in both areas showed non-necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis in hilar adenopathy and patchy fibrosis of mesenteric fat. The picture was classified as sarcoidosis-like reaction and mesenteric panniculitis secondary to pembrolizumab. Anti-PD1 agents cause hyperactivation of the immune system through T-cell proliferation. Sarcoid-like reaction is a very rare complication that can mask progressive tumor disease. Awareness of immunorelated complications by oncologists, internists, and radiologists is important for an appropriate diagnostic approach and targeted test ordering.",2024 Nov 18,20241118.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on adverse effects of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, not COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on adverse effects of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, not COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications associated with pembrolizumab treatment in lung cancer patients, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications associated with pembrolizumab treatment in lung cancer patients, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

Thus, when presenting with respiratory failure and pulmonary opacities, pneumonia must be considered. However, while rare, immunomodulating medications used in the treatment of multiple myeloma can also cause potentially life-threatening respiratory failure, a distinction which has important treatment implications. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old male with recently diagnosed multiple myeloma undergoing treatment with lenalidomide and daratumumab presented with acute, rapidly progressive hypoxic respiratory failure ultimately requiring intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. Imaging revealed bilateral pulmonary opacities, however infectious workup was negative, and he was ultimately diagnosed with lenalidomide-induced interstitial pneumonitis, a rare but serious adverse effect of this medication. He was treated with drug discontinuation and methylprednisolone, and quickly recovered. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide is an immunomodulating medication used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and is associated with rare but serious cases of drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis. Thus, if a patient receiving lenalidomide develops shortness of breath and/or hypoxia, drug-induced pneumonitis must be on the differential.

While most cases of opsoclonus are associated with autoimmune or paraneoplastic disorders, infectious agents, trauma, or remain idiopathic, opsoclonus can also be caused by medications affecting neurotransmission. This review was prompted by a case of opsoclonus occurring in a patient with Multiple System Atrophy, where amantadine, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, appeared to induce opsoclonus. METHODS: Case report of a single patient and systematized review of toxic/drug-induced opsoclonus, selecting articles based on predefined criteria and assessing the quality of included studies. RESULTS: The review included 30 articles encompassing 158 cases of toxic/drug-induced opsoclonus. 74% of cases were attributed to bark scorpion poisoning, followed by 9% of cases associated with chlordecone intoxication. The remaining cases were due to various toxics/drugs, highlighting the involvement of various neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, glycine, and sodium channels, in the development of opsoclonus.

Our team previously developed a simple, safe, and cost-effective method for obtaining high yields of pure and functional NK cells from cord blood (CB) without the need for cell sorting, feeder cells, or multiple cytokines. We present the case of a 52-year-old female patient diagnosed with poorly differentiated stage IVB (T3N2M1) endometrial cancer, who exhibited leukemoid reaction and pretreatment thrombocytosis as paraneoplastic syndromes. The patient received two courses of CB-derived NK (CB-NK) cell immunotherapy between March and September 2022, due to her extremely low NK cell activity. Two available CB units matched at 8/10 HLA with KIR-mismatch were chosen, and we were able to produce NK cells with high yield (>1.0x10(10) NK cells), purity (>90%), and function (>80%) from CB without cell sorting, feeder cells, or multiple cytokines. These cells were then adoptively transferred to the patient. No adverse effects or graft-versus-host disease were observed after infusion of CB-NK cells. Our clinical experience supports the efficacy of CB-NK cell treatment in increasing NK cell activity, depleting tumor activity, improving quality of life, and reducing the size of abdominal and pelvic masses with the disappearance of multiple lymph node metastases through the regulation of systemic antitumor immunity. Remarkably, the white blood cell and platelet counts decreased to normal levels after CB-NK cell immunotherapy.

Lanthanum carbonate is a commonly used phosphate binder for patients with CRF and hyperphosphatemia, but has adverse effects if patients are not monitored. This report is of a 47-year-old man with hyperphosphatemia due to CRF treated with lanthanum carbonate tablets who presented acutely with partial large bowel obstruction. The incidence of lanthanum carbonate causing intestinal obstruction is rare, and few cases in the literature have described the course of the disease in detail. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old man diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy underwent hemodialysis treatment and was prescribed 0.5 g/day of chewable lanthanum carbonate tablets. After taking lanthanum carbonate for 5 months, the patient experienced symptoms of decreased bowel movements and exhaustion, which progressively worsened. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple hyperdensities in the large bowel, indicating the presence of lanthanum deposition. Lanthanum carbonate was promptly discontinued. After undergoing enema and catharsis treatment, the large bowel obstruction was relieved, and the hyperdensities in the abdominal CT disappeared. The colonoscopy and histologic examination revealed ulcerations and inflammatory changes in the large bowel mucosa. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the rare association between the use of lanthanum carbonate tablets and intestinal obstruction. Healthcare providers should enhance their vigilance regarding lanthanum carbonate-induced serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions and actively seek to detect lanthanum deposition by abdominal CT or radiography (X-ray).

37226438,PMC10226673,Severe Neutropenia and Hepatotoxicity After Carbimazole Drug Therapy for Hyperthyroidism in a Pediatric Patient: A Case Report.,Alnajjar LI||Alkahtani R||Alasqah MA||Alanizi A||Bin Sheraim N||Alwahhabi B||AlAboud M||Alhubaishi AA,"BACKGROUND Hyperthyroidism is an overproduction of thyroid hormones. Carbimazole is an anti-thyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism in adults and children. It is a thionamide associated with rare adverse effects such as neutropenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and hepatotoxicity. Severe neutropenia is a life-threatening event characterized by a sharp drop in absolute neutrophil count. Severe neutropenia can be treated by discontinuation of the precipitating medication. Administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor provides longer protection against neutropenia. Elevated liver enzymes indicate hepatotoxicity, which usually normalize after discontinuation of the offending medication. CASE REPORT A 17-year-old girl was treated with carbimazole since the age of 15 for hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves' disease. She initially received 10 mg of carbimazole orally twice daily. After 3 months, the patient's thyroid function reflected residual hyperthyroidism and was then up-titrated to 15 mg orally in the morning and 10 mg orally in the evening. She presented to the emergency department reporting fever, body aches, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain for 3 days. She was diagnosed with severe neutropenia and hepatotoxicity induced by carbimazole after 18 months of dose modification. CONCLUSIONS In hyperthyroidism, it is important to maintain patients in a euthyroid state for a long period to minimize the autoimmunity and hyperthyroid relapse, which often requires long-term use of carbimazole. However, severe neutropenia and hepatotoxicity are rare and serious adverse effects of carbimazole. Clinicians should be aware of the importance to discontinuation of carbimazole, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, and supportive treatment to reverse the consequences.",2023 May 25,20230525.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications and adverse effects related to carbimazole treatment for hyperthyroidism, not vaccinations against COVID-19, which does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications and adverse effects related to carbimazole treatment for hyperthyroidism, not vaccinations against COVID-19, which does not meet the specified criteria.",2,90,,

Surgical resection is the primary treatment for PDD, but it poses risks to the aesthetic appearance and functional integrity of the anus. Moreover, its clinical application is limited, particularly in cases of lesions present in multiple skinfold areas, multiple and recurrent lesions, extensive lesion areas, or in elderly patients with poor health. Hematoporphyrin derivative photodynamic therapy (HpD-PDT) serves as an alternative treatment for patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery and for conditions characterized by extensive and discontinuous disease. Here, we present the case of a 70-year-old man with PPD, presenting perianal skin lesions extending beyond the dentate line into the anal canal. When considering HpD-PDT, it is essential to take into account the preservation of function, patient preferences, and potential adverse effects. Subsequent to HpD-PDT, the lesion was effectively eradicated, and anal function was preserved without any notable proliferative, atrophic scarring, or other side effects.

Bidirectional intraoperative chemotherapy (BDIC) using concurrent intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy in combination with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is an emerging treatment option for selected cases of MPM. It is a locoregional treatment that involves intraoperative chemoperfusion of heated chemotherapy. The administration of systemic along with intraperitoneal chemotherapy allows for a bidirectional chemotherapy gradient in peritoneal tumor cells. The aim of this treatment is eradication of microscopic residual cancer cells after major removal of macroscopic tumor nodules. To date, there is no consensus on the chemotherapeutic regimen that can be used in BDIC to manage MPM in patients with severe renal impairment. Administering intravenous ifosfamide with hyperthermic intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin is a promising regimen in treating peritoneal mesothelioma. Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting adverse effect of cisplatin and ifosfamide. Therefore, dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. CASE REPORT In this report, we describe a 46-year-old female patient with recurrent MPM and severe renal impairment. Her treatment was managed with hyperthermic intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin along with intravenous ifosfamide following CRS. The cisplatin dose was reduced to 50% and the ifosfamide dose was reduced by 25%. The patient tolerated the procedure well, without deterioration in her renal function. At her 9-month follow-up, she did not report experiencing chemotherapy-related adverse effects, and her kidney function remained stable.

Based on the increasing evidence describing its safety and efficacy, ketamine was added to local protocols for pain management. This study aimed to evaluate differences in pain management and adverse effects of ketamine and opioid administration. Data from pediatric patients who received ketamine or an opioid in the W/L MCA EMS system from October 2019 to March 2021 were analyzed. The primary outcome was the difference in pain score, and the secondary outcome was adverse effects observed after analgesic administration. The decrease in pain scores was greater among ketamine patients (mean: 5.2) compared to opioid patients (mean: 2.9), p < 0.001.

Immune-mediated adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occur in the acute phase and are monophasic after CAR T-cell therapy. However, late-onset inflammatory and neurological toxicities have not been well studied. We encountered a patient with recurrent late-onset inflammatory toxicities and progressive dysautonomia after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. A 69-year-old man was treated with CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy for transformed follicular lymphoma. Triphasic inflammation with stomatitis, cytopenia, and noninfectious pneumonia was first observed 7 months after CAR T-cell infusion. Progressive dysautonomia was also observed and eventually fatal. Residual CAR T cells, predominantly central memory CD4+ cells, were detectable in peripheral blood approximately 1 year after CAR T-cell infusion. The cytokine profile with the lack of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-1beta elevation in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid was inconsistent with that of typical CRS or ICANS. The persistence of central memory CD4+ CAR T cells might be associated with unique manifestations of late-onset immune-mediated adverse effects. More cases should be accumulated to elucidate the mechanism and establish the optimal management strategy of late-onset immune-mediated toxicities previously unrecognized.",2023,20230421.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to CAR T-cell therapy, specifically late-onset inflammatory toxicities and dysautonomia, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to CAR T-cell therapy, specifically late-onset inflammatory toxicities and dysautonomia, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

Vismodegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor approved by the FDA for use in this type of tumor. We present a case series to describe our experience with the use of vismodegib. METHODS: A retrospective study that included patients treated with vismodegib at our dermatology unit was conducted. Monthly follow-up was performed, and we registered the clinical evolution and adverse reactions. RESULTS: A total of six patients with locally advanced BCCs were included (50% males and 50% females), with a mean age of 78.5 years old. The treatment was administered over a mean of 5 months. A complete response was observed in four cases and partial response in two cases. No recurrence was detected, with a median follow-up duration after discontinuation of 18 months. Most patients (83%) had at least one adverse event, and two needed dose adjustment temporarily or permanently to continue. The main adverse effect was muscle spasms (66.7%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients aged 50 to 80 undergoing gastric radical surgery were randomly assigned to the remimazolam group (group R) or the propofol group (group P), receiving remimazolam or propofol-based intravenous anesthesia, respectively. The primary outcome measured was peri-operative serum stress indicators and lymphocyte subtypes. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic vitals, recovery quality, postoperative pain profiles and potential adverse effects. RESULTS: The demographic and surgical characteristics of the 60 analyzed patients were comparable. The absolute counts of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cell decreased significantly on POD1 compared with baseline. On POD3, the numbers of CD3+CD4+ cells in group R were lower than baseline and Group P, whereas the CD3+CD8+ cell counts in both groups were lower than baseline, with group R higher than group P. The CD3-CD16+CD56+ cell numbers in both groups on POD1 and POD3 decreased significantly compared to baseline with group P lower than group R on POD3. The serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ACTH and COR rose sharply 2 hours after the beginning of surgery compared to baseline. Notably, all these parameters in group R were higher than those in group P. Additionally, blood pressure and intra-operative vasoactive drug frequency in group R were higher than that in group P. No significant differences in recovery quality, postoperative pain profiles, and potential adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam-based intravenous anesthesia might favour the recovery of cellular immune function in early postoperative period compared to propofol. On the contrary, remimazolam was inferior to propofol in suppressing surgical stress.

While anti-PD1 lichenoid reactions are well known, only a few cases of bullous lichen planus have so far been reported in the medical literature. Herein we described a case of secondary bullous lichen planus associated with nivolumab and we present a systematic review of all anti-P1-induced cases reported in the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three months after beginning treatment with nivolumab for metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma, a 68-year-old man presented pruritic purplish papules on his limbs that subsequently became bullous. Clinical-histological correlation led us to a diagnosis of secondary bullous lichen planus induced by nivolumab. Systemic steroids and withdrawal of immunotherapy resulted in clinical improvement. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE: Our systematic review revealed 20 cases of lichen planus induced by anti-PD1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) published between 2016 and 2018, 6 of which were of the bullous form. Treatment and maintenance or discontinuation of anti-PD1 were dependent on severity. DISCUSSION: Bullous lichen planus has been reported only rarely in the context of nivolumab therapy. The timeline for development of cutaneous adverse reactions under anti-PD1 immunotherapy may last weeks or months and regular monitoring is required. Withdrawal of immunotherapy should only be considered where the outcome under systemic corticosteroids is unfavourable.",2020 Mar,20200122.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses adverse effects related to anti-PD1 therapy, specifically nivolumab, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses adverse effects related to anti-PD1 therapy, specifically nivolumab, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

The ICI agent nivolumab induces anti-tumor immune responses by inhibiting the programmed cell death 1 protein, but side effects include cardiac immune-related adverse events (irAE) such as myocarditis.(1) The association of nivolumab with atherosclerotic disease has been rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old man with metastatic melanoma and recent myocardial infarction (MI) presented with recurrent MI after having undergone several cycles of nivolumab therapy. Repeat cardiac catheterization revealed rapidly progressive in-stent restenosis and diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) requiring bypass surgery and warranting cessation of nivolumab therapy. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab has been linked with dysregulation of immune responses including enhanced T cell activity, which is implicated in CAD. The timing of nivolumab therapy and presentation with non ST elevation myocardial infarction in this patient suggests a serious T cell-driven medication adverse effect. Therefore, close monitoring for atherosclerotic disease progression is warranted in patients on immunotherapy.",2020 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on adverse effects of immunotherapy with nivolumab.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on adverse effects of immunotherapy with nivolumab.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically nivolumab, and their association with acute coronary syndrome, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically nivolumab, and their association with acute coronary syndrome, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

The optimal management of unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer (UAPC) remains an open research question. In this study, the tumors shrank significantly after PD-1 antibody combined with chemotherapy in two UAPC patients, and both have achieved R0 (pathologically negative margin) resection and survival to date. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1: A 53-year-old man was diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Stage III). He received six cycles of PD-1 antibody plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. The tumor was reduced from 11.8x8.8 cm to ""0"" (the pancreatic head was normal as shown by enhanced computed tomography, ECT) after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (PNT) and the adverse effects were tolerable. The patient underwent radical surgery and achieved R0 resection. Case 2: A 43-year-old man diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis (Stage IV) received three cycles of PD-1 antibody combined with chemotherapy. The tumor was reduced from 5.2x3.9 cm to 2.4x2.3 cm with no side effects. The patient also underwent radical surgery and achieved R0 resection. CONCLUSION: PD-1 antibody plus a chemotherapy regimen resulted in a surprising curative effect and safety in two patients with UAPC, which may portend an improvement in pancreatic carcinoma treatment. We may have a way for UAPC patients to obtain radical treatment and gain long-term survival.

It is characterized by sharp, stinging, or electric shock-like pain in the distribution area of the occipital nerve, which often causes patients acute pain and discomfort. To report on the feasibility of non-drug therapy in addressing this condition, we present a case report showcasing the remarkable improvement in occipital neuralgia symptoms achieved with a single acupuncture session, followed by a brief period of care. CASE REPORT The patient was a 76-year-old man who had persistent head pain for over a decade. This pain significantly disrupted his daily activities and diminished his quality of life. Seeking to avoid pharmacological treatments, with their associated adverse effects, and invasive surgical procedures, the patient opted for acupuncture treatments. Over a period of 12 days, the patient underwent 6 acupuncture sessions, each carefully planned and performed by a skilled acupuncturist, ensuring utmost safety and precision. Astonishingly, following the very first session, the patient reported significant alleviation from his head pain. CONCLUSIONS Although the initial approach to managing occipital neuralgia often primarily revolves around conservative drug treatment, acupuncture has emerged as a highly effective modality in alleviating pain symptoms associated with this condition. The favorable outcome of this case report provides convincing evidence that acupuncture can serve as a highly advantageous treatment approach for occipital neuralgia.

Despite advances in preventive measures, MARSI events still occur, and individualized care must be designed to meet patient needs. CASES: This article describes three cases where skin injuries occurred because of application, removal, and ongoing use of a medical adhesive device; all three cases occurred underneath dressings used to secure and protect the skin adjacent to a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). The first case describes evaluation and management of a skin tear in an elderly female with multiple comorbid conditions, and Case 2 describes assessment and care of contact irritant dermatitis occurring under a PICC dressing. In both cases, specialist nurses with knowledge of MARSI assessed and managed the skin underneath the medical adhesive device in a manner that allowed maintenance of the PICC and continuation of therapy. In contrast, Case 3 describes a female with irritant contact dermatitis underneath a PICC dressing that was responding to care by the nurse specialists of a vascular access team. In this case, the patient presented to their facility's emergency department with severe itching. The vascular access team initially was not consulted, and the PICC line was removed, although inspection revealed dry skin without signs of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Medical adhesive-related skin injury is a clinically relevant and useful construct that identifies a variety of prevalent conditions associated with the use of medical adhesive device such as tapes and PICC dressings.

A double-lumen tube was placed in the subcutaneous pocket as the intra-soft tissue antibiotic perfusion (iSAP) tube. No bone mobility was observed around the bone defect and nail, and replacement of the implant was not necessary. Beta-tricalcium phosphate was transplanted to the bone defect, and negative pressure wound therapy was applied. Gentamicin was injected continuously through iMAP and iSAP. Finally, the infection was eradicated, and cortical bone bridging was observed without additional surgery or adverse effects.

This report describes a 68-year-old man with acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis associated with alcohol intoxication while taking low-dose escitalopram, an SSRI antidepressant. CASE REPORT The patient, with a history of bipolar affective disorder managed with escitalopram, presented with symptoms of general malaise, diarrhea, myalgias, and transient loss of consciousness following substantial ethanol consumption. Laboratory tests indicated severe rhabdomyolysis with a creatine kinase level of 37 672 U/L and myoglobin level >5710 ng/ml, leading to an AKI diagnosis. The discontinuation of escitalopram, along with hydration and renal replacement therapy, facilitated renal recovery. However, the reintroduction of escitalopram resulted in the recurrence of rhabdomyolysis, suggesting a probable causal link, confirmed using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the importance of identifying the medication history in patients presenting with acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis and the association with SSRIs, which can be exacerbated by alcohol. This case underscores the importance of vigilant medication history assessment in patients presenting with AKI and rhabdomyolysis, particularly concerning the use of SSRIs like escitalopram, which can pose heightened risks in the context of alcohol use. It highlights the need for clinical caution in managing patients on long-term SSRI therapy, especially when reintroducing such medications after an episode of rhabdomyolysis.",2024 Jul 2,20240702.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.

37990483,PMC10681956,A 21-Year-Old Woman with Sickle Cell Disease and Vaso-Occlusive Pain Associated with Using an Electronic Nicotine Dispensing System (E-Cigarette or Vape) - a Case Report.,Girish G||Xiang B||Hsu LL,"BACKGROUND Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that leads to multisystem complications. The heterogeneous course of sickle cell disease is due to both genetic modifiers and environmental factors. Cigarette smoking is a strong risk factor for sickle cell complications and even secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke can be detrimental for individuals with sickle cell disease. However, no prior reports have associated e-cigarettes and sickle cell vaso-occlusive pain. CASE REPORT A 21 year old woman presented with sickle cell disease SS complicated by frequent pain, multiple acute chest syndrome episodes, sickle cell nephropathy, and avascular necrosis of the left hip, plus mild intermittent asthma. She developed pain in the ribs and back after her first use of e-cigarettes. After 4 days of home pain management, she came to the Emergency Department. She was mildly hypoxic and received supplemental oxygen. Chest radiograph did not show airspace consolidation, and the sites of pain were consistent with her prior pain episodes, so the diagnosis was sickle cell vaso-occlusive pain. Her hemoglobin was more than 2 g/dL below baseline and she received a red blood cell transfusion on hospital day 2. Overall, this was among her more severe pain episodes. CONCLUSIONS The rising popularity of e-cigarettes, also known as vapes or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), is partly due to the misconception that they are safer than traditional cigarettes. Although firm conclusions will depend on studies designed to provide rigorous evidence, this case suggests that the acute adverse effects of ENDS might trigger complications of sickle cell disease, especially with asthma as a comorbidity.",2023 Nov 22,20231122.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the association between e-cigarette use and vaso-occlusive pain in a patient with sickle cell disease.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the association between e-cigarette use and vaso-occlusive pain in a patient with sickle cell disease.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to sickle cell disease and the use of e-cigarettes, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to sickle cell disease and the use of e-cigarettes, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,90,,
37264337,PMC10236744,Deep venous thrombosis and hyponatremia associated with citalopram use for behavioral symptoms in Parkinson's disease: a case report.,Albalawi A,"BACKGROUND: Evidence is limited regarding the optimal therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for mood disorders and behavioral symptoms in older adults with cognitive impairment, but they have limited efficacy in patients with PDD. The effect of SSRIs on hemostasis is also unclear. This report describes a patient with PDD who developed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and hyponatremia after initiating citalopram treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year-old woman with PDD presented to our emergency department with altered mental status, generalized weakness, and left lower leg swelling. Citalopram was begun 4 weeks previously for behavioral changes and was discontinued 2 days before presentation because of excessive fatigue. At presentation, her plasma sodium level was 123 mg/dL. Brain computed tomography showed age-related changes. Doppler ultrasound revealed a DVT in the left lower leg. The patient was treated with hypertonic saline and intravenous heparin. After normalization of her sodium, she was discharged on donepezil and apixaban. At follow-up, her sodium remained normal, and her cognition and behavior were noticeably improved. CONCLUSION: Older adults with Parkinson's disease are sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic agents, including SSRIs, which are not recommended first-line agents for behavioral symptoms in PDD. Upon initiating SSRIs in older patients with functional decline and multiple comorbidities, physicians need to evaluate the patient's risk factors for bleeding or thrombosis.

Due to its rarity, treatment strategies for KD are still under exploration. This paper reports a case of a 37-year-old Chinese female presenting with generalized erythematous papules and pruritic eruptions for 12 years, followed by the onset of limb swellings 3 years later, ultimately diagnosed as Kimura's disease. Considering the patient's multiple lymphadenopathies and limb swellings with concurrent atopic dermatitis, the treatment regimen included initial dupilumab dosage of 600 mg (300 mg administered in two injections), followed by subcutaneous injections of 300 mg every two weeks for four months. Concurrent oral corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, initial dose 16 mg/kg/day, gradually tapered with tumor regression) was also administered. Following treatment, the patient did not experience severe adverse effects, and the multiple nodules markedly decreased in size. Additionally, serum IgE levels, eosinophil, and basophil counts showed significant reductions.

38902140,,CT-guided hydrogel injection for brachytherapy in cervical cancer: A case report.,Wang Y||Zhang F||Hu K||Yu L||Zhang J||Luo C||Yu L||Yan J,"Rectal toxicity is a significant concern in cervical cancer radiotherapy. Despite advancements in image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT), rectal morbidity remains a challenge. Injectable hydrogel showed promise in creating a space between the vagina and rectum, reducing rectal radiation dose; however, the traditional ultrasound-guided injection revealed some problems, such as the inadequate separation of the upper edge of the cervix, which can be mitigated through adopting CT-guided injection. This case report presents the successful use of computed tomography (CT)-guided hydrogel injection to limit rectal doses and improve treatment outcomes. A forty-year-old female with stage IIIC1r cervical cancer received external-beam radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Due to the proximity of the tumor to the rectum, a CT-guided hydrogel injection was performed to increase the distance between the cervix and rectum. Post-injection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated increased distances between the cervix and rectum. Subsequent MRI-based IGBT achieved high clinical target volume doses while limiting rectal doses. During the six-month follow-up, the patient reported only mild adverse effects. CT-guided hydrogel injection offers advantages over ultrasound-guided injection in cervical cancer radiotherapy. The technique allows for better puncture position adjustment, reduced reliance on specialized ultrasound expertise, and shorter puncture distances. This case report highlights the potential of hydrogel injection as a viable method to reduce rectal morbidity and improve treatment outcomes in a broader range of cervical cancer patients. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore its applicability in larger cohorts.",2024 Winter,20240619.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on cervical cancer treatment and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on cervical cancer treatment and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case report on CT-guided hydrogel injection for brachytherapy in cervical cancer, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case report on CT-guided hydrogel injection for brachytherapy in cervical cancer, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for both conditions are often used cautiously due to fear of adverse effects. If a clinically indicated therapy is not initiated due to fear of adverse effects, the quality of life of affected patients may significantly be reduced. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented to the department of psychiatry of a university hospital with depressed mood, pronounced anxiety, and nihilistic thoughts. While several pharmacological treatments remained without clinical response, further behavioral observation in conjunction with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) revealed the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To counter the pharmacological treatment resistance of psychotic depression, we decided to perform electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Remarkably, ten sessions of ECT yielded an almost complete remission of depressive symptoms. In addition, the patient's delusional ideas disappeared. A follow-up (18)F-FDG PET/CT after the ECT series still showed a frontally and parieto-temporally accentuated hypometabolism, albeit with a clear regression compared to the previous image. The follow-up (18)F-FDG PET/CT thus corroborated the diagnosis of FTD, while on the other hand it demonstrated the success of ECT. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, ECT was a beneficial treatment option for depressive symptoms in FTD.

Although wide surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, it is often difficult to complete marginal en-bloc resection due to adjacent neurovascular components in the spine. Separation surgery, a partial resection to achieve circumferential separation and high-dose irradiation such as postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy, has received much attention as a new therapy for spinal tumors. However, little evidence regarding separation surgery with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for a spinal myxofibrosarcoma exists. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 75-year-old man with progressive myelopathy. Radiological examination revealed severe spinal cord compression due to an unknown widespread multiple tumor in the cervical and thoracic spine. Computed tomography-guided biopsy showed high-grade sarcoma. Positron emission tomography detected no other tumors in the body. Separation surgery was therefore performed with posterior stabilization. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed storiform cellular infiltrates and pleomorphic cell nuclei. Histopathology identified high-grade myxofibrosarcoma. Postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy of 60 Gy in 25 fractions was completed without any adverse effects. The patient had greatly improved neurological function, was capable of walking with a cane, and had no recurrence for at least 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS We reported a case of an unresectable high-grade myxofibrosarcoma of the spine successfully treated with the combination of separation surgery and postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy.

CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old male unintentionally received gentamicin during spinal locoregional anesthesia for a urological procedure. During the first 48 hours the patient presented upper extremity dysmetria, dysarthria, and bilateral abducens nerve paralysis from which he recovered completely. He remained asymptomatic from day 3 to 10 after the incident. On day 11 he presented an acute vestibular syndrome. Severe bilateral vestibulopathy was confirmed by means of video head impulse testing. From day 14 onwards, he presented a persistent horizontal left-beating nystagmus, showing no variation or signs of compensation after 14 months, not responding to intensive vestibular rehabilitation or vestibular suppressant drugs. During follow-up, intercurrent gaze-evoked/direction-changing nystagmus has been recorded in various opportunities.

CASE PRESENTATION: A chronic tobacco-betel nut chewer 62-year-old male patient had dysphagia with hoarseness of voice diagnosed with stage III, grade II malignant pyriform fossa. The patient underwent 9 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Inj Paclitaxel 100 mg and Inj Cisplatin 40 mg. He was then referred to our institute for Radical Radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy with adjunct Ayurvedic treatment. A total dose of 70 Gy of radiation with cobalt 60 source was administered to the bilateral face and neck, in 35 fractions. Patient also received 6 cycles of concurrent weekly chemotherapy with Inj Cisplatin 40 mg. He received well-planned adjunct Ayurvedic treatment in the form of oral Ayurvedic medicines (OAM) and detoxifying treatment, Panchakarma. All the measured adverse effects of radiotherapy such as Stomatitis, Xerostomia, Taste Alteration, Dysphagia, and Nausea were observed to be remarkably low during and post radiotherapy in this patient. Karnofsky and Quality of Life (QoL) scores revealed patient's well-being throughout the treatment course. After 5 years, PET CT scan revealed no FDG avid locoregional recurrence or distant organ involvement implying disease-free survival (DFS). Various chemokines, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were assessed during the course of treatment to observe tumour microenvironment. CONCLUSION: The present case of Head &amp; Neck Cancer (HNC), stage III, and grade II belonged to high-grade, high-risk hypopharyngeal cancer with poor prognosis. The patient opted for Ayurvedic treatment besides radiotherapy, which continued thereafter for 5 years. We therefore emphasize that in this case, minimum side effects of radiotherapy, immunomodulation, and reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress along with good quality of life can be attributed to OAM and repeated detoxifying Panchakarma treatment supported with healthy diet and good lifestyle. The highlight of the study is the marked effect on the patient's immune response and reduction in oxidative stress, leading to 5 years and beyond of DFS.",2024,20240918.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case study related to the treatment of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case study related to the treatment of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

This report describes a 54-year-old man with a chronic cough and painful nonunion fracture of the left posterior 8th rib, managed with minimally invasive surgery and a rib splint. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man presented with chronic cough-induced left chest wall pain. Three-dimensional chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a nonunion of a fracture of the left posterior 8th rib. After medical management failure, we proposed a surgical approach with the aim to remove the tissue comprising the nonunion, release the nerve, and stabilize the bone stumps. To avoid the adverse effects of a large incision, we designed a minimally invasive strategy based on ultrasound fracture localization and the use of an intramedullary splint. The pain disappeared immediately after surgery. The patient was discharged in 24 hours. At 6-week follow-up, he was still asymptomatic, and a new CT scan reconfirmed the correct splint position. From the immediate postoperative evaluation until the last follow-up visit, he consistently reported full satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS This report has highlighted the challenges of management of chronic pain in nonunion of a rib fracture, and has described the use of a minimally invasive surgical approach. In this single case, our tailored surgical strategy achieved definitive success in pain management, minimizing postoperative complications/adverse effects and avoiding the addition of pain medications despite a 24-hour hospital stay.

33729843,,Topical oxygen treatment relieves pain from hard-to-heal leg ulcers and improves healing: a case report.,Palin L||Nordgren M||Lingemark A||Jebril W||Wikstrom JD,"Pain from hard-to-heal wounds is common and challenging to manage with current therapies. Most hard-to-heal wounds show some degree of hypoxia that impairs healing and contributes to pain. Regular oxygen therapy is given in hyperbaric oxygen chambers and is costly, time-consuming and cannot be offered to most patients. Moreover, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) only increases tissue oxygen for a short time and is given only for a few hours per week. Topical oxygen therapy (TOT) was introduced as an alternative and in this report we focus on topical continuous oxygen therapy (TCOT), which has been shown to be associated with healing of hard-to-heal ulcers. We report on a patient with type 1 diabetes with a painful hard-to-heal lower leg ulcer that failed to heal with standard wound dressings and that had insufficient response to pharmacological analgesia. The patient was on three different analgesics before treating the wound with TCOT. As the wound was considered hypoxic, due to longstanding diabetes and probable microangiopathy, TCOT was commenced. Within one week of treatment starting, the patient spontaneously ceased all his analgesics as he was free of pain; and after 2.5 months, the ulcer healed. The patient reported no adverse effects. In addition to promoting healing, TCOT may also be considered for its potential analgesic effects in hard-to-heal wound management.",2021 Mar 2,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of topical oxygen therapy for treating hard-to-heal leg ulcers and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of topical oxygen therapy for treating hard-to-heal leg ulcers and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Immunohistochemically, the disease can express melanocytic and myogenic markers, such as HMB45, HMSA1, MelanA/Mart1, and actin. The disease can be seen in almost every organ, especially the uterus and retroperitoneum. Adrenal gland-derived PEComa is extremely rare and leads to difficulties in diagnosis. Here, we present a case of a adrenal gland PEComa in which we applied postoperative radiation therapy. CASE REPORT A 24-year-old female patient visited the doctor in April 2022 due to abdominal pain that had been increasing steadily for the previous few months. Abdominopelvic computed tomography shows a solid mass of 10 cm on the right adrenal gland. Right adrenal gland mass excision surgery was performed in May 2022. The pathology was reported as malign PEComa. The patient was admitted for postoperative radiotherapy because of uncertainty about the surgical boundaries. Systemic treatment was not required. A fraction dose of 4680 cGy/26 was applied by 8-field IMRT to the tumor bed area. In December 2022, the patient's radiotherapy was completed. No acute adverse effects from the radiotherapy were observed. The patient's follow-up after treatment continued, without disease and long-term adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS Surgical resection is the primary treatment approach in the treatment of localized disease.

Her electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance were diagnostic of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. There was no documented ventricular arrhythmia or syncopal episodes and Holter recordings were repeatedly normal. Cardiac hemodynamics showed right to left shunt through atrial septal defect, low pulmonary blood flow, normal atrial pressures, and minimally elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Since her presenting symptoms and cyanosis were attributed to reduced pulmonary blood flow, she underwent off-pump cavopulmonary anastomosis between right superior vena cava and right pulmonary artery. As we intended to avoid the adverse effect of extracorporeal circulation on the myocardial function and pulmonary vasculature, we did not attempt to reduce the size of the atrial septal defect. Her postoperative period was uneventful; oxygen saturation improved to 89% with significant improvement in effort tolerance. At 18-month follow-up, there were no ventricular arrhythmias on surveillance. The clinical presentation of this disease may vary from serious arrhythmias warranting defibrillators and electrical ablations at one end to right ventricular pump failure warranting cardiomyoplasty or right ventricular exclusion procedures at the other end. However, when the presentation was unusual with severe cyanosis through a stretched foramen ovale leading to reduced pulmonary blood flows, Glenn shunt served as a good palliation and should be considered as one of the options in such patients.",2020 Jul,20170820.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a cardiovascular case.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a cardiovascular case.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of cavopulmonary anastomosis in a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of cavopulmonary anastomosis in a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.",2,95,,

A case report.,Li P||Luo L||Luo D||Wang R,"BACKGROUND: Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare disease that can lead to profound coagulopathy and hemorrhage, especially when combined with the laceration and bleeding of other organs. Intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) has been widely used for treating obstetric hemorrhage, but it remains unclear whether ICS can be used in the treatment of AFE. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 27-year-old woman at 39 weeks' gestation who suddenly developed severe abdominal pain, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and decreased vital signs during labor. Despite an emergency cesarean section being performed, the parturient experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Fortunately, the heart rate spontaneously recovered after effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Further abdominal exploration revealed right hepatic laceration with active bleeding. ICS was performed and the salvaged blood was promptly transfused back to the patient. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with AFE based on hypotension, hypoxia, coagulopathy, and cardiac arrest. The patient was transfused with 2899 mL salvaged blood during surgery with no adverse effects. At 60- and 90-day follow-ups, no complaints of discomfort or abnormal laboratory test results were observed in the mother or the baby. CONCLUSION: ICS was used to rescue patient with AFE, and ICS did not worsen the condition of patients with AFE.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty female patients aged 65-80 years undergoing selective general anesthesia were randomized into two groups: Group R+F received an initial dose of remimazolam (7.5 mg) with fentanyl (1 mug/kg), while Group R received remimazolam alone. Dosing adjustments (+/-2.5 mg) were made based on the response of the preceding patient using the up-and-down allocation technique. The ED50 and ED95 were calculated using a sequential formula and probit regression. Probit regression was also used to assess the relative potency of remimazolam between groups. Sedation levels were evaluated using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale. RESULTS: The ED50 for remimazolam was significantly lower in Group R+F compared to Group R (p= 0.007). Probit regression estimated the ED50 and ED95 values for Group R+F at 4.878 mg (95% CI, 3.845-5.859) and 8.184 mg (95% CI, 6.636-13.546), respectively. In contrast, Group R demonstrated ED50 and ED95 values of 6.733 mg (95% CI, 5.533-8.068) and 11.298 mg (95% CI, 9.101-19.617), respectively. CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence that the administration of 1 mug/kg of fentanyl significantly reduces the required sedative dose of remimazolam by approximately 30% during induction in elderly patients. Importantly, the concomitant use of 1 mug/kg of fentanyl does not increase the risk of adverse effects such as hypotension, respiratory depression.",2024,20240822.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the effects of fentanyl and remimazolam on sedation, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on the effects of fentanyl and remimazolam on sedation, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the effects of fentanyl on remimazolam sedation in elderly patients and does not discuss complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}",The article focuses on the effects of fentanyl on remimazolam sedation in elderly patients and does not discuss complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,95,,

Intractable cases are not uncommon and represent a major treatment challenge. Therefore in this study, we examine the effect of a topical immunomodulator agent, imiquimod, on refractory IGM. Patient 1 had IGM for 9 months and had not responded to the existing treatments. She responded to a 7-week course of imiquimod. In patient 2, the disease had begun 4 months sooner and had been resistant to all treatments; it responded to imiquimod after 4 weeks. Ulcers appeared on the skin of both patients but resolved safely. OUTCOME: Both patients were very satisfied with the results.

She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and mild intellectual disability during her adolescence; despite being hospitalized for a period of 10 years beginning in her 30s, she continued to exhibit symptoms of impulsivity, and explosive behavior, requiring periods of isolation. We ultimately decided to switch her medication to clozapine, which was administered with caution and gradually titrated upward, with no discernable adverse effects, resulting in a marked improvement in her symptoms and obviated the need for isolation. Subsequently, the patient's history of congenital heart disease and facial abnormalities prompted initial suspicions of a 22q11.2DS diagnosis, which was subsequently confirmed through genetic testing.

These molecules are metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes in vivo, hence they are contraindicated or recommended to be avoided in combination with strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, namely posaconazole (strong) and isavuconazonium (moderate). However, no literature has been published on the impact this interaction has on patient safety and tolerability. In this case series, we report five cases in which CGRP antagonists and azole antifungal therapy were given concurrently, to provide real-world outcomes of this interaction. DATA SOURCES: Electronic medical records at our hospital system were reviewed between January 2021 and December 2023 to find patients who met the criteria of hematological malignancy, taking CGRP-antagonist and azole antifungal therapy. Records were then further investigated to find cases where CGRP antagonists and azole antifungals were used concomitantly. DATA SUMMARY: Concurrent use of CGRP antagonists and azole antifungal therapy was feasible for patients with migraines and hematological malignancies. None of the patients experienced any grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity from the proposed over-exposure to CGRP antagonist. The combination was well tolerated without any need for therapy discontinuation or dose modifications.

Reduction of the retinal capillary hemangioma vascularity and enhancement of its fibrosis associated with the attenuation of the feeder vessel were also observed. Ophthalmic examination showed no adverse effect except for a mild transient vitreous haziness after each injection. Electroretinogram performed 4 weeks after the first injection revealed no retinal toxicity.

STB management remains challenging; the first-line approach consists of medical treatment, while surgery is reserved for patients with complications. No data regarding STB treatment with bedaquiline-containing regimens are available in the literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we report the case of a 21-year-old man from Cote d'Ivoire with a multidrug resistance STB with subcutaneous abscess. After approval of the hospital off-label drug committee, we started bedaquiline 400 mg daily for two weeks, followed by 200 mg three times per week, for 22 weeks, associated with linezolid 600 mg daily, rifabutin 450 mg daily, and amikacin 750 mg daily (interrupted after eight weeks). During treatment, we performed a weekly EKG. No QT prolongation was shown, but inverted T waves appeared, requiring several cardiological consultations and cardiac MRI, but no cardiac dysfunction was found. After 24 weeks, bedaquiline was replaced with moxifloxacin 400 mg daily. The patient continued treatment for another year. We performed another computer tomography at the end of treatment, confirming the cure.

Serious adverse events are rare and may be poorly understood. This report describes an early surgical intervention to address tissue necrosis resulting from misplaced subcutaneous buprenorphine injection. We review identifying characteristics that distinguish the necrotic reaction from other adverse effects of subcutaneous buprenorphine and offer guidance to continue treatment with subcutaneous buprenorphine. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old patient returned to clinic within an hour of his buprenorphine injection, reporting pain and skin changes unlike his previous injections. Non blanching erythema consistent with early necrosis was evident, and the patient was referred for surgical removal of his buprenorphine depot. The patient had uncomplicated healing of the surgical site and was provided sublingual buprenorphine before returning to continue treatment with subcutaneous buprenorphine. DISCUSSION: Although skin necrosis is known to be a rare complication of subcutaneous buprenorphine injection, early surgical excision to limit injury has not been described. Signs and symptoms of skin necrosis must be better understood to facilitate early intervention and continued treatment.

We performed TKA of the left knee, placing a Stryker posteriorly stabilized prosthesis. Three days later, blisters developed near the buttocks and thighs and, on day 10 after surgery, around the operative site. A skin biopsy revealed BP. Commencing on day 14 after surgery, prednisolone 10 mg was administered twice daily. The symptoms improved by 3 weeks after surgery and were healed at 4 months. After 1 year, we performed TKA of the right knee. On day 2 after surgery, as formerly, blisters developed on the buttocks and an immediate biopsy revealed BP. Commencing on day 3 after surgery, prednisolone 10 mg was administered twice daily. On day 10 after surgery, the blisters on the buttocks had improved and no blisters were observed at the surgical site. All symptoms had resolved by 2.5 months after surgery.

After the use of linezolid 600 mg BD for 8 days patient developed altered sensorium and breathlessness and had high bilirubin, SGOT, and SGPT. She was diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy. Linezolid was withdrawn and after 10 days all laboratory parameters for liver function test were improved. CONCLUSION: Care should be taken when prescribing linezolid in such patients with pre-existing risk factors as they are prone to develop hepatotoxic and neurotoxic adverse effects even after short-term use of linezolid.",2024,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of linezolid, not vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of linezolid, not vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

In contrast, the quadratus lumborum block (QLB) utilizes a simple and easy fascial plane technique and provides a wide area of sensory blockade. Thus, the QLB may be beneficial as analgesia after total hip arthroplasty. CASE: Here, we report the case of an 83-year-old man who received a continuous transmuscular QLB as part of a multimodal analgesia after hardware removal and total hip arthroplasty. The patient received a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 8 ml/h through an indwelling catheter in addition to patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous fentanyl and oral celecoxib.

38141216,,Enteral N-acetylcysteine to reduce serum cobalt concentrations secondary to prosthetic knee-associated metallosis: A case report.,Floyd CA||Carr JR||Brock L||Orvin DL,"PURPOSE: Cobalt metallosis is a rare but dangerous complication of total joint arthroplasty resulting from deterioration of the joint leading to metal-on-metal friction and breakdown. Potential manifestations vary in severity and include dilated cardiomyopathy, thyroid dysfunction, cognitive disturbances, neuropathy, fatigue, and weakness. The therapeutic role of N-acetylcysteine in metallosis has been investigated due to its ability to chelate with heavy metal ions, such as cobalt and chromium. SUMMARY: Here we report the case of a 71-year-old female who presented with suspected metallosis diagnosed in the outpatient setting due to symptoms of significant weight loss and failure to thrive. This metallosis was secondary to the hardware breakdown of a left knee revision roughly 6 years previously. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to her poor nutrition status and was started on nasojejunal tube feeds along with N-acetylcysteine 600 mg by mouth twice daily for 45 days. The patient's serum cobalt levels decreased from 61.7 microg/L on admission to 16.2 microg/L prior to her undergoing proper revision of the left knee roughly 2 months after admission to the hospital. The patient tolerated treatment well and was able to be discharged the day after surgery, with no further complaints or complications. CONCLUSION: This case report contributes to the body of literature suggesting that administration of N-acetylcysteine can reduce serum cobalt concentrations, without notable adverse effects, in the context of prosthetic knee-associated metallosis.",2024 Mar 21,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of cobalt metallosis and the use of N-acetylcysteine for treatment, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of cobalt metallosis and the use of N-acetylcysteine for treatment, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.",2,95,,

We present a case of aortic thrombosis with visceral malperfusion during ECPELLA management for PCCS. We performed the Bentall procedure, mitral valve repair, tricuspid annuloplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft on a 73-year-old man admitted with congestive heart failure caused by annuloaortic ectasia, along with severe aortic and mitral regurgitation. VA-ECMO and Impella were required, since the cardiopulmonary bypass weaning was difficult. Impella was removed on postoperative day 4. On postoperative days 5 and 6, laboratory data showed worsening renal dysfunction, lactate levels, and acidosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed thrombosis in the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Aortic thrombectomy was performed. Hyperkalemia, caused by a reperfusion injury, resulted in ventricular fibrillation. Continuous hemodiafiltration improved the hyperkalemia. However, irreversible acidosis progressed, and the VA-ECMO flow rate could not be sustained. On postoperative day 7, the patient died. Perioperative use of Impella for PCCS may be effective in improving postoperative cardiac function.

Although there are no absolute contraindications regarding its use in people living with HIV (PLWH), the prescription of this drug has been principally limited in patients with oncohematological diseases. In this report, we described the outcome of four PLWH who underwent RTX therapy after the diagnosis of immune-mediated renal disease. The main RTX-associated adverse effects were leukopenia, late-onset neutropenia and decline of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts.

However, co-administration with many drugs may delay the excretion of MTX which may cause serious adverse effects if the serum concentration exceeds 0.1 micromol/L 72 h after an intravenous infusion. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old Japanese female with PCNSL was treated with high-dose MTX-based chemotherapy. The serum MTX concentration 72 h post-infusion was 0.153 micromol/L when she was taking levofloxacin (LVFX) but <0.1 micromol/L 72 h after 4 subsequent infusions when she was not taking LVFX. She was given many other drugs but the timing of the short course of LVFX and the fact that ciprofloxacin also delays MTX excretion suggests that LVFX was the cause.

Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that results in excessive copper accumulation in the body, where penicillamine is an effective treatment option for copper chelation. Penicillamineinduced SJS-TEN is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect. There is increased susceptibility to SJS/TEN in HIV infection due to immunosuppression and chronic liver disease due to impaired hepatic function. OBJECTIVE: To diagnose and manage the occurrence of the rare severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions in the backdrop of immunosuppression and chronic liver disease. CASE REPORT: We are reporting penicillamine-induced SJS-TEN overlap in a 30-year-old male with Wilson's disease, HIV and Hepatitis B who was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins.

34477079,,Diagnostic Delays for Non-melanoma Skin Cancers in Renal Transplant Recipients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: What is Hiding Behind the Mask?,Mokos M||Basic-Jukic N,"Dear Editor, The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and remains a global challenge. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Even though the COVID-19 vaccine has become available since December 2020, the main preventive measures still include social distancing, hand washing, and the use of protective face masks. By May 22, 2021, 3,437,545 deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been registered by WHO, confirming the burden of this disease (1). Consequently, the pandemic has become a challenge for health care systems, as they had to be focused on the care of patients with COVID-19. During the first lockdown from March to May 2020, it was advised to postpone clinical visits whenever this could be done without risk. This recommendation was mainly aimed at older patients and those with chronic diseases, as it has been shown that they are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19. Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are at a greater risk for infections and different cancers due to their permanent immunosuppressive therapy. The most common malignancies in RTRs are skin cancers, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers. It has been estimated that RTRs have a 65-250 times higher risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 10 times higher risk for basal cell carcinoma, and 2-5 times higher risk for melanoma when compared with the general population (2-4). RTRs are at a higher risk for complications from COVID-19, not only because of their immunosuppressive therapy but also because of different comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (5). Therefore, RTRs tend to limit their medical visits and postpone clinical examinations for skin cancer screenings. Moreover, during clinical visits the patients are commonly asked to keep their protective masks on, increasing the risk of overlooking their facial skin changes. Herein we present two RTRs who developed skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the tumors were diagnosed with a significant delay. Patient 1 A 67-year-old woman with unknown primary kidney disease received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2014. The immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In January 2020, she had noticed a reddish squamous lesion on her right cheek, which enlarged slowly. Since there were no other symptoms, she postponed the dermatologic examination. Additionally, she further postponed the visit to her physician during the pandemic as she wanted to avoid social contact as much as possible. One year later, at the nephrologist's examination, she was asked to take off her face mask for a skin check, and two skin tumors on her right cheek were noticed (Figure 1). One lesion was located at the angle of her mandible and presented as a hypertrophic, sharply marginated lesion with central crusting and a diameter of 2 cm. The other lesion was at the right zygomatic region and appeared as a scaly, erythematous lesion with a diameter of 7 mm. The patient was referred to a dermatologist, and a biopsy of both lesions was indicated. The pathohistological analysis revealed cutaneous SCC in situ for the mandibular lesion and actinic keratosis for the zygomatic lesion. SCC in situ has been excised, and actinic keratosis was treated by cryosurgery. Patient 2 A 66-year-old woman received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2010 due to chronic glomerulonephritis without biopsy. The immunosuppressive protocol included basiliximab induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In June 2020, an erosion occurred at her left infraocular area and did not heal but instead gradually enlarged. The patient suspected that the ""wound"" developed due to the friction from the rim of her eyeglasses. Six months later, the nephrologist noticed the erosion which was 10x5 mm in size with a slightly elevated, pearl-colored margin (Figure 2). The patient was referred to a dermatologist who indicated tumor excision due to suspected basal cell carcinoma. The pathohistological analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis. DISCUSSION Both presented patients did not inform their family physicians about their skin changes because they avoided all non-nephrological medical visits during the pandemic. The additional reason for the diagnostic delay was the fact that they kept the masks on their faces during most examinations, with the skin lesions behind the mask consequently remaining unnoticed. The problem of diagnostic delay of skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized by several studies. Canadian authors compared the number of biopsies for skin cancers during the first 15 weeks in 2020 and during the same period in 2019. They found a decrease in the number of biopsies for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and melanoma of 18% and 27%, respectively (6). A multicenter study performed in northern-central Italy showed that the number of skin cancer (NMSC and melanoma) diagnoses fell by 56.7% in weeks 11 to 20 of 2020 compared with the average number noted in the same periods of 2018 and 2019 (7). Furthermore, a single-center retrospective study in Italy demonstrated that the number of advanced skin cancers surgically treated between May 18 and November 18, 2020, was significantly higher than in the same period in 2019. These findings led the authors to conclude that the surgical excisions were postponed due to the delay in follow-ups, which resulted in increased incidence of advanced skin cancers (8). RTRs are at particular risk of severe consequences from diagnostic delay with regard to skin cancers. Namely, skin cancers in RTRs are more aggressive and are associated with a higher incidence rate of metastases and recurrences than in the general population (9). Therefore, RTRs should be advised to regularly check their skin for potential skin cancer, which includes self-examinations and dermatologic follow-ups.",2021 Jul,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the diagnostic delays for non-melanoma skin cancers in renal transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the diagnostic delays for non-melanoma skin cancers in renal transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,

Currently, treatment options for CAEBV are limited. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only way to cure CAEBV. Here, we report a rare case of CAEBV manifesting as massive pericardial effusion that was successfully treated with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade immunotherapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 36-year-old woman with intermittent chest distress and dyspnea for 8 months was admitted to our center on October 25, 2021. Laboratory tests showed leukocytopenia and elevated liver enzyme levels. Initial echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion. DIAGNOSIS: High levels of EBV-DNA were detected in the pericardial fluid by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. The pathological diagnosis of her left inguinal lymph node and skin lesions revealed systemic CAEBV.

Common pharmacologic management strategies include 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, antipsychotics, antihistamines, and antimuscarinic agents; however, these agents incur risks of adverse effects. One of the most worrisome risks of commonly used antiemetics is prolonging the QT interval and the associated risk of torsades de pointes. To avoid the dangers of pharmacologic treatment of nausea and vomiting, previous studies in emergency medicine and postoperative settings suggest that inhaled isopropyl alcohol is an inexpensive, safe, and effective nonpharmacologic intervention.

37563017,,Breaking barriers: Stereotactic ablative proton and photon radiation therapy for renal cell carcinoma with extensive metastases: A case report.,Ma MW||Wang ZS||Li HZ||Gao XS||Liu C||Ren XY||Zhang WL||Yang KW,"Patients with advanced renal cancer (RCC) often have limited success with systemic therapy due to tumor heterogeneity. However, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been shown to have a beneficial therapeutic effect for oligometastatic disease when used early. Despite this, current guidelines recommend the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the first-line therapeutic agent for patients with recurrent or metastatic kidney cancer. Additionally, there is limited data on the combination of systemic treatment and SABR for extensive metastatic RCC due to concerns about high toxicity. Proton therapy offers a promising treatment option as it emits energy at a specific depth, generating high target doses while minimizing damage to normal tissue. This allows for precise treatment of various tumor lesions. In this case report, we describe a high-risk 65-year-old male with extensive pleural and thoracic lymph node metastases and 2 bone metastases of clear cell renal cancer. While the targeted therapy and immunotherapy effectively treated the bone metastases, it was not effective in treating the chest metastases, including the pleural and lymph node metastases. Thus, the patient received full-coverage radiotherapy with photon for primary renal tumor and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for thoracic metastases. The patient showed no evidence of disease for 1 year after the initial radiotherapy, and no severe SABR-related adverse effects were observed until now. The combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy with full-coverage radiotherapy may be a promising treatment option for selected patients with extensive metastatic renal cancer, especially as proton therapy allows for more precise control of the beam and minimal damage to normal tissue. This case has motivated us to investigate the potential advantages of administering proton therapy concurrently with systemic therapy in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.",2024 Spring,20230808.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a case report on the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The input item discusses a case report on the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

Although generally well tolerated, a growing number of reports have recently shown association of long-term IFN-beta therapy with several types of glomerulonephritis. Here, we present the case of a 42-year-old woman with MS who developed nephrotic-range proteinuria after taking IFN-beta1b for nine years. Initially, due to the presence of histological features consistent with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (granular IgA deposits in mesangial lesions), a tonsillectomy plus steroid pulse therapy was performed. However, proteinuria did not significantly decrease after these treatments. Therefore, a second renal biopsy was performed after three years, revealing a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like pattern without immune complex. Further immunofluorescence analysis showed attenuated IgA staining. Consequently, IFN-beta1b was replaced with dimethyl fumarate, resulting in complete remission, with proteinuria decreasing to the level of 0.2 g/day.

The use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been increasing dramatically in the last few years. Therefore, their adverse effects and complications have also been increasing. Herein, this report describes a 73-year-old man with type 2 DM treated with empagliflozin presenting with asymptomatic bacteriuria, vertebral osteomyelitis and iliopsoas abscess due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. CASE REPORT We report a 73-year-old man with DM on empagliflozin who presented with back pain of 1-month duration with elevated inflammatory markers. On lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), he was found to have lumbar vertebral osteomyelitis and left iliopsoas abscess. His symptoms were improved with abscess drainage and antimicrobial therapy. The source of infection was most likely asymptomatic bacteriuria, which may have been secondary to empagliflozin treatment, as evidenced by the urine, the blood, the bone and abscess cultures revealing growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae with the same susceptibility profile. CONCLUSIONS This particular case reinforces the significance of potential complications of DM and SGLT2 inhibitors' adverse effects, especially the increased risk of infections, and can aid clinicians in expanding the differential and enabling them to reach an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Although vertebral osteomyelitis is a less common cause of back pain, physicians should keep it in the differential diagnosis whenever a patient's back pain is chronic and associated with motor weakness.",2024 Jul 19,20240719.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to the use of empagliflozin in a patient with type 2 diabetes, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to the use of empagliflozin in a patient with type 2 diabetes, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

Preclinical studies reported early severe ocular damage related to the use of belantamab mafodotin (belamaf), including ocular surface inflammation, severe dry eye, and a specific toxicity to the cornea, namely microcystic keratopathy. While belamaf-induced ocular changes have not been prospectively studied, a better understanding of mechanisms involved as well as kinetics may aid in anticipating dose adjustment rather than stopping the treatment once clinical ocular damage is too severe. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old woman scheduled for belamaf as a fifth-line treatment against multiple myeloma was prospectively included. Clinical examinations were performed before and every 3 weeks afterward, together with in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) of the cornea. Visual acuity, symptoms, slit-lamp examination, and ultrastructural changes of the cornea were recorded according to the received dose of belamaf. More precisely, kinetics, shape, density, and location of the toxic corneal lesions have been followed and analyzed using IVCM. Also, specific lesions at the sub-basal nerve plexus layer were detected and characterized for the first time. This advanced approach allowed a better understanding of the belamaf-induced toxicity, further balancing the dose to maintain good vision and eye health while continuing the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic ultrastructural analysis and follow-up of the corneal state during ADCs treatment for multiple myeloma may open new avenues in the therapeutic approach.

36960611,,Effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the wish to hasten death in palliative care: A case report in advanced cancer.,Decazes E||Rigal O||Clatot F,"OBJECTIVES: The suffering experienced by some patients at the end of their lives can lead to a wish to hasten death (WTHD). It is sometimes an existential suffering, refractory to palliative care even if well conducted, which leads to this desire. Since several years, in psychiatry, the rapid anti-suicidal effects of a single injection of ketamine have been proven. WTHD and suicidal ideation have similarities. The injection of a single dose of ketamine could have an efficiency on the desire to hasten death. METHODS: We report the case of a woman with advanced breast cancer expressing a WTHD, treated by ketamine. RESULTS: A 78-year-old woman expressed a WTHD (request for euthanasia) because of existential suffering following a loss of autonomy related to cancer. The suicide item was 4 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). She had no associated pain or depression. A single dose of intravenous ketamine 1 mg/kg over 40 min plus 1 mg of midazolam was injected. She had no adverse effects. From D1 post-injection to D3, the WTHD disappeared completely with a MADRS suicide item at 0. At D5, the WTHD started to reappear, and at D6, the previous speech was completely back. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS: These results suggest an effect of ketamine on WTHD. This opens up the possibility of treating existential suffering at the end of life.

39115413,,Bilateral Hemorrhagic Occlusive Retinal Vasculitis Induced by Osimertinib in a Patient with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,Park NH||Park BH||Kwon HJ||Park SW||Byon I,"PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral retinal vasculitis in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing treatment with osimertinib. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma (T4N3M1a stage IV) presented with blurry vision in both eyes (OU). Eighteen months before symptom onset, the treatment was changed from afatinib (20 mg/day) to osimertinib (80 mg/day) because of tumor progression. The visual acuity was 20/30 and 20/25 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Clinical examination revealed few anterior chamber cells, 2+ vitreous cells, haze, and multiple retinal hemorrhages in the peripheral retinas (OU). Fluorescein angiography revealed retinal vasculitis with a severely non-perfused area in the periphery. These findings indicated hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV). Osimertinib was reduced to 40 mg/day, and oral prednisolone was started at 30 mg/day. This improved retinal vasculitis; however, the ischemic area did not improve. Pan-retinal photocoagulation was performed while tapering the oral prednisolone to 10 mg/day. Although macular edema (ME) occasionally occurred (OU), systemic and local treatment with steroid-stabilized HORV and ME helped increase the dose of osimertinib to 80 mg/day without cancer progression for 18 months. Her visual acuity remained 10/20 (OU).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the clinical symptoms and signs of two leukaemia patients with suspected TRALI from the same female donor. HLA phenotyping was performed on the two patients, the platelet donor, her husband and her two children. The HLA and human neutrophil antigen antibodies in the donor's plasma were identified. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations of two leukaemia patients were those of TRALI, and we treated them with timely ventilator support. A high titre of HLA-II antibodies was in the plasma of the platelet donor. The antibodies were directed at HLA-DRB3*03:01, HLA-DRB1*09:01, HLA-DRB1*12:02, HLA-DRB3*01:01 and HLA-DRB1*12:01:01G, which were specific to the HLA antigens of the two patients.

39695951,PMC11653540,A rare case report of severe aplastic anaemia caused by long-term use of zidovudine.,Zhou J||Wang Q||Yu Y||Chen L||Shi J||Huang C||Zhuang R,"BACKGROUND: Zidovudine is an antiviral drug used to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Anaemia is a common adverse effect of zidovudine that usually occurs in the first 2 to 4 weeks of initial treatment. Here, we describe a patient with HIV infection who developed severe aplastic anaemia 11 years after taking zidovudine. To our knowledge, this is the first case of severe aplastic anaemia caused by the long-term use of zidovudine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old male patient with AIDS developed severe aplastic anaemia after taking zidovudine for 11 years. The patient went to the emergency department due to weakness and falls. He was diagnosed with severe anaemia because his haemoglobin (Hb) level was 31 g/L and his red blood cell (RBC) count was 0.89 x 10(12)/L. Gastrointestinal bleeding, haematological diseases and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia were ruled out by gastroenteroscopy, stool routine examination and bone marrow puncture biopsy after admission. When the causality of adverse drug reactions was assessed, the Naranjo score of zidovudine was 8, indicating that severe aplastic anaemia was likely related to zidovudine. Given that bone marrow suppression is a side effect of zidovudine, this drug was discontinued. Lamivudine and dolutegravir sodium tablets were subsequently used as antiviral therapies. The patient's symptoms of anaemia improved with the transfusion of suspended RBCs, oral polysaccharide iron complex capsules and folic acid tablets. After 2 weeks of treatment, the patient's symptoms of fatigue improved, with a Hb level of 70 g/L and a RBC count of 2.13 x 10(12)/L, which were significantly better than before, and he was discharged. At the follow-up 6 weeks after discharge, the patient's Hb level was 156 g/L, his RBC count was 4.67 x 10(12)/L, and the anaemia was resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Zidovudine has bone marrow suppression toxicity, which manifests as anaemia and can occur at any stage of use.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present a literature review and report a case of denosumab as a possible cause of ICRR in a patient with breast cancer with 2 years of follow-up. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old female with a history of luminal breast cancer was treated with denosumab semiannually for osteopenia with discontinuation 1 year ago. Oral examination revealed areas of ICRR lesions on two mandibular teeth. The patient presented irreversible pulpitis on the lower left first molar (#19). The lower right first premolar (#28) was asymptomatic, and the resorption cavity was restricted to the tooth crown. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) established the ICRR 2Bp and 2Ad diagnosis in teeth #19 and #28, respectively. Periodontal surgery and a nonsurgical root canal were performed in the molar and restorative treatment was performed in the premolar. Two years after treatment, both teeth were functional and asymptomatic, and probing was within normal limits (< 3 mm) without bleeding. Periapical radiographic examination revealed no progression of resorption nor new lesions.

Although the liver is a preferential organ for irAEs, the immuno-pathogenesis underlying hepatic irAEs has been poorly understood. We describe a 57-year-old man with Stage IV lung cancer who underwent the first-line regimen composed of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Nivolumab treatment (3.2 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) was initiated when the disease progressed after the first chemotherapy. Sequential occurrence of irAEs involving the multiorgan systems was observed. He developed hepatic irAEs (Grade 3) after endocrine, lung, and cutaneous irAEs. Lobular hepatitis characterized by predominant infiltration of CD8(+) T cells was seen in the liver biopsy specimens. Interestingly, defective accumulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) was evident in this case with hepatic irAEs as compared with typical cases with autoimmune hepatitis.

39212555,,Camrelizumab Combined with Apatinib for Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Two Case Reports.,Chen N||Zhang L||Gao A||Piao L||Quan X||Shen X,"Aims/Background: Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is a common complication of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC typically infiltrates intrahepatic vessels, particularly the portal vein, leading to the formation of PVTT, marking advanced-stage HCC and correlating with poor prognosis. PVTT often complicates local treatment strategies such as surgical resection and affects the efficacy of interventions. Combination therapy, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy, shows promise in HCC treatment, but management options for HCC patients with PVTT are incompletely characterized. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab + apatinib in treating HCC patients with PVTT. Case Presentation: Two cases of HCC with PVTT were presented. Patient 1, a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B virus, was diagnosed with stage IIIA HCC and treated with camrelizumab + apatinib, achieving complete response (CR) after six cycles. Patient 2, a 50-year-old male with stage IIIA HCC, also underwent the same treatment and achieved CR after four cycles but died due to acute cardiac disease. Results: Our research found that camrelizumab + apatinib effectively shrank the size of filling defects and significantly prolonged patients' progression-free survival. In addition, no adverse effects were observed during the treatment process. However, despite the manageable safety profile demonstrated by combination therapy, further clinical research is needed to validate its long-term efficacy and safety.

39042933,,Immune checkpoint blockade effect on immunologic and virologic profile of five cancer patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.,Yazji A||Brown EN||De La Torre R||Umoru GO,"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have changed the prognostic outlook for several malignancies. Despite the unprecedented durable responses and improvement in survival outcomes with ICIs, exclusion of oncology patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from most ICI-related trials has limited utility of these agents. Clinical outcomes related to concomitant use of antiretroviral therapy and ICI remain unclear. We present a case series based on our institution's experience to address this unmet need of clinical outcomes with ICI in oncology patients living with HIV. METHODS: Electronic medical records were queried to identify patients living with HIV who were also diagnosed with cancer and treated with ICI from May 2019 to September 2022. RESULTS: A total of five patients were on concurrent antiretroviral therapy and immunotherapy. From an efficacy perspective, three patients were observed to have a response (one complete response, one partial response, and one stable disease). There were three patients with known cluster of differentiation (CD4 + ) levels who had an increase in CD4  +  cell count with ICI treatment. The HIV viral load remained undetected in most of the patients on ICI treatment. No confirmed immune-related adverse effects were documented for any patients in this review. CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors may be efficacious and tolerable for treatment of cancer in patients living with HIV. Upward trends in CD4  +  cell counts observed in this case series suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors may enhance HIV disease control.

A significant adverse effect can develop unexpectedly, and off-label drug use may control this adverse effect and other lupus manifestations. The current research in lupus relies solely on multiple composite outcome measures, which vary from one study to another. However, the optimal drug for a particular lupus symptom is presently unclear, requiring additional research for definitive clarification. CASE REPORT Here, we report a typical case of SLE in a 54-year-old Saudi female patient who presented with mucocutaneous symptoms and arthritis. She had a positive serology for antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA. Owing to the failure of conventional drugs, the use of belimumab resulted in significant improvements. She later developed worsening symptoms that progressed from alopecia areata (AA) to alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU). She partially responded to systemic and local steroid injections. All measures to taper her steroid failed despite the use of azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Belimumab was stopped due to lack of efficacy. She was re-challenged with belimumab after she showed partial response to steroid therapy, but this clearly resulted in worsening of her hair loss to AT. The use of baricitinib following the second discontinuation of belimumab resulted in a significant improvement in AT and arthritis.

However, there is a growing concern regarding severe immune-related adverse events. A 78-year-old man with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, treated with pembrolizumab and axitinib, was admitted to the emergency department 30 days after initiating treatment due to rapidly progressive myositis. Myocarditis with severe ventricular dysfunction was identified. Muscular biopsy findings were compatible with inflammatory myopathy associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids showed an insufficient response. Therapeutic escalation on the third day with methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, and abatacept resulted in clinical improvement. On the eleventh day, a sudden malignant arrhythmia occurred, followed by cardiac arrest. This represents one of the first case reports describing myocarditis and myositis during treatment with pembrolizumab-axitinib.

Its use is restricted to third-line due to adverse effects which include myocarditis. Australia reports the highest incidence of clozapine-associated myocarditis (CAM) in the context of pharmacovigilance and relatively rapid titration. An audit of patients commenced on clozapine within the Central Adelaide Local Health Network (CALHN) between 2012 and 2015 found an incidence of 8.6 %. We present here a case series from a follow up audit considering titration relevant risk factors for CAM. We reviewed anecdotal cases and data from all hospital-based commencements of clozapine across CALHN for the period July 2021 to June 2022 using pharmacy and medical record databases. We identified 5 cases of CAM and all had risk factors impacting on clozapine metabolism, including rapid titration, elevated baseline CRP, Asian ethnicity and concomitant treatment with inhibitors of clozapine metabolism. While personalisation of clozapine treatment needs further investigation in prospective trials, slower titration to lower targets for risk groups may not impact on hospital length of stay and has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of adverse events. Australian manufacturer approved titration rates exceed those recommended for personalised dosing and may not be safe for patients with risk factors. Early clozapine levels at week two could identify slow metabolisers for dose adjustment.

Although generally considered non-threatening, cases that persist can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. This study presents a case of a male patient in his 30s experiencing unyielding twitching localized to the sole of his left foot for 2 years. His medical history was devoid of any notable neuromuscular diseases. Results from electromyography testing were also normal for all parameters. Attempts with pharmacological intervention did not yield any improvement of his condition. Although a nerve block targeting the left tibial nerve managed to reduce the severity of the twitching, it failed to decrease its frequency or provide a lasting solution. In search of a more effective treatment, botulinum toxin was administered via ultrasound guidance into the flexor hallucis and digitorum longus muscles. This approach resulted in a marked reduction in both the frequency and severity of the twitching, enabling the patient to resume his daily activities and achieve restful sleep without experiencing any adverse effects.

Although many reports have demonstrated positive effects of lid hygiene on demodicosis, some have produced conflicting results. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of lid margin cleansing with a novel lid hygiene detergent, Eye Shampoo, in patients with ocular demodicosis. METHODS: Outpatient clinic notes recorded over a 24-month period between June 30, 2016, and June 29, 2018, at Keio University Hospital in Japan were reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with ocular demodicosis who started cleansing their lid margins with Eye Shampoo at least once daily as a lid hygiene therapy. RESULTS: Five patients diagnosed with ocular demodicosis who started cleansing their lid margins using Eye Shampoo for lid hygiene were identified. In four cases, Demodex mites were successfully eliminated, and ocular conditions were ultimately improved with no recurrence. Active Demodex mites were still noted after 3 months of lid hygiene therapy in one case; further observation of this case was not available.

Evidence for pharmacogenomic-guided dosing of antipsychotics is not as robust, especially for cytochrome P450 1A2 metabolized agents such as olanzapine and clozapine. Herein, we present a case involving a patient suspected of having poor CYP1A2 metabolism. Therapeutic drug monitoring of olanzapine was employed to guide the titration of clozapine following olanzapine failure. Despite pursuing pharmacogenetic testing, no meaningful results were obtained due to the omission of CYP1A2 variants associated with poor metabolism. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Caucasian male with schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder presented with extrapyramidal symptoms due to antipsychotic polypharmacy, resulting in multiple falls. He experienced a partial response to olanzapine 40 mg, thus his dose was increased to 50 mg. Sampling an olanzapine trough revealed a supratherapeutic level of 152 ng/mL. Given his history of EPS and other reported adverse effects from antipsychotics, including clozapine, pharmacogenomic testing was pursued. The patient cross-tapered to clozapine slowly, with the knowledge that the patient would likely exhibit elevated levels of olanzapine. Clozapine was efficacious and tolerated well. As expected, the patient exhibited higher clozapine trough concentrations for someone of his age, ethnicity, and gender. Pharmacogenomic testing yielded no relevant findings relating to olanzapine or clozapine metabolism. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the utility of TDM over pharmacogenetic testing for patients on these medications with a suspected alteration in CYP1A2 metabolism. therapeutic drug monitoring emerges as a more practical approach with stronger evidence for its use, particularly in cases of suspected reduced CYP1A2 activity, where suballeles resulting in decreased enzyme function are not readily detectable on standard commercial pharmacogenomic panels.",2024 Dec 4,20241204.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing for olanzapine and clozapine, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing for olanzapine and clozapine, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing in the context of olanzapine and clozapine, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing in the context of olanzapine and clozapine, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

SUMMARY: We describe the short-term use in 2 cases of an alternative purge solution for patients with an Impella 5.5 ventricular assist device undergoing PET scans to rule out infection and malignancy. Sodium chloride solutions cannot be used with Impella ventricular assist devices even for short periods of time due to the potential for motor corrosion.

39708358,PMC11670715,Hydroxychloroquine as a Promising Therapy for Systemic IgG4-Related Disease: A Case Report.,Fijn R||Janssens N||Bodar E||Nagtegaal MM||Karim F,"BACKGROUND IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic fibro-inflammatory disease potentially affecting every part of the human body. Because of variability in clinical presentation, IgG4-RD can be challenging to diagnose. Untreated disease can lead to irreversible organ damage such as fibrosis. Early recognition and therapy are therefore essential. The first step in the treatment of IgG4-RD is glucocorticoid therapy, but the relapse rate after tapering is high. Other agents that are commonly used are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and rituximab. Hydroxychloroquine is not common in the treatment of IgG4-RD, but can be promising. CASE REPORT We here describe a case of a patient with systemic IgG4-RD with manifestation in the pancreas, lung, and salivary glands. Initial treatment consisted of prednisone, with good response. Because of relapse after tapering, prednisone was restarted in combination with azathioprine. However, azathioprine had to be discontinued because of adverse effects. While tapering prednisone, new pulmonary manifestations emerged and hydroxychloroquine was started. This led to an excellent clinical response with no additional adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS This case report on IgG4-RD demonstrates a good response to treatment with hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine is believed to have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, which may favorably influence the treatment of IgG4-RD. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine may be a good treatment option in IgG4-RD. Larger cohorts are required to study the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in IgG4-RD.",2024 Dec 21,20241221.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

We report a case of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy that was aggravated by G-CSF. A 56-year-old Japanese man with no relevant medical history was admitted to our hospital as a donor of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for transplantation. To mobilize PBSCs, he received subcutaneous G-CSF (lenograstim), 500 mug for 4 days. Three days after the first dose of lenograstim, gross hematuria appeared, and after administration on the fourth day, renal dysfunction and nephrotic-range proteinuria were observed. Renal biopsy and light microscopic study revealed mild mesangial proliferation with expansion in association with the presence of cellular segmental crescents. Immunofluorescence study revealed diffuse, granular staining in the mesangium for IgA, complement component 3 (C3), and lambda light chains. We diagnosed highly active IgA nephropathy and initiated treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine. Three months later, renal function returned to normal.

In this report, we present the case of a 12-year-old female with a SDHB-related metastatic paraganglioma treated with surgery followed by temozolomide therapy. The patient presented with symptoms of palpitations, sweating, flushing and hypertension and was diagnosed with a paraganglioma. The primary mass was surgically resected six weeks later after appropriate alpha- and beta-blockade. During the surgery extensive nodal disease was identified that had been masked by the larger paraganglioma. Histological review confirmed a diagnosis of a metastatic SDHB-deficient paraganglioma with nodal involvement. Post-operatively, these nodal lesions demonstrated tracer uptake on (18)F-FDG PET-CT. Due to poor tumour tracer uptake on (68)Ga-DOTATATE and (123)I-MIBG functional imaging studies radionuclide therapy was not undertaken as a potential therapeutic option for this patient. Due to the low tumour burden and lack of clinical symptoms, the multi-disciplinary team opted for close surveillance for the first year, during which time the patient continued to thrive and progress through puberty. 13 months after surgery, evidence of radiological and biochemical progression prompted the decision to start systemic monotherapy using temozolomide.

36413511,PMC9701529,Lisinopril-Induced Small Bowel Angioedema: An Unusual Cause of Severe Abdominal Pain.,Johnson BW||Rydburg AM||Do VD,"BACKGROUND Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are one of the most frequently prescribed classes of medications with the rare adverse effect of angioedema, and isolated small bowel angioedema is a small subset of these cases. Isolated angioedema of the small bowel is a rare adverse effect of this commonly prescribed medication, and it mimics, symptomatically and radiographically, several other illnesses and is often misdiagnosed. While ACE-I are thought to be safe, the risk of angioedema is approximately 0.7%. Isolated small bowel angioedema is often not diagnosed in a timely manner, and misdiagnosis leads to significant morbidity in afflicted patients. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with angioedema of the small bowel causing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Computed tomography demonstrated small bowel edema and ascites. The patient had been taking lisinopril for 7 years prior to presentation and had previously been seen by multiple physicians for abdominal pain. A diagnosis of ACE-I-induced small bowel angioedema was made and lisinopril therapy was immediately stopped. Her symptoms improved with cessation of lisinopril, and follow-up imaging showed resolution of the angioedema 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS The course of ACE-I-induced angioedema is unpredictable and often overlooked as a cause of abdominal pain. It commonly presents soon after starting ACE-I therapy, but can present years after therapy initiation, as in this case. Significant morbidity, including unnecessary exploratory laparotomy, is associated with misdiagnosis of ACE-I-induced angioedema of the small bowel.

It is considered a safe medication with minimal adverse effects, with the most common being gastrointestinal. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare but life-threatening complication. MALA usually occurs in patients with kidney dysfunction. However, it can still occur with preserved kidney function with the ingestion of a large dose of metformin. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old man with a significant medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented after an intentional ingestion of a high dose of metformin (3000 mg/day). He was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea lasting for 3 days. His initial laboratory findings were remarkable, with a serum creatinine level of 819 micromol/L. Arterial blood gas revealed severe lactic acidosis, with a pH of 6.94, HCO(3)(-)- of 3 mEq/L, anion gap of 48 mmol/L, and lactate level of 15 mmol/L. Emergent continuous renal replacement therapy was done. Two days later, his condition improved considerably, and the lactic acidosis was resolved entirely. He was discharged on day 11 of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS MALA is rare but life-threatening complication of treatment with metformin. MALA should be considered when there is evidence of metformin ingestion and renal insufficiency in patients with lactic acidosis.

Hypoglycemia has rarely been reported due to aspirin and indomethacin use but not of any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CASE REPORT: A 69-years old endocrinologist participated as a control in a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) study. He decreased his plasma glucose to 1.8 mmol/L and developed full-blown hypoglycemic symptoms during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). He had taken a 50 mg diclofenac tablet at 10 pm the evening before for a harmless muscle stretch in the lower back. Apart from well-controlled hypothyroidism he was healthy. During medical school he often had reactive hypoglycemia which came after intake of a carbohydrate rich but otherwise poor breakfast followed by bicycling. However, he had never experienced problems later in life after more decent meals containing slower absorbable carbohydrates. A 3-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed three weeks after the OGTT test. A glucose value of 3.1 mmol/L was registered on the third CGM day in the afternoon after intake of 500 mg aspirin in the early morning the same day. Otherwise, all values were normal. A second OGGT where no medications apart from levothyroxine had been taken during at least a 2-week period adjacent was normal. Detailed analyses of the OGTTs showed that the GLP-1 levels before the test were higher after diclofenac exposure while the insulin levels increased after the glucose challenge which suggesting uncoupling.

One of the most common adverse effects of affatinib is diarrhea, which may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) due to severe plasma volume loss; however, no case of glomerular injury directly induced by afatinib has been reported to date. Here, we describe the case of a 53-year-old Japanese male patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who twice developed AKI requiring dialysis, once after starting and once after increasing the dose of afatinib. Although serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative, crescentic glomerulonephritis with no immune deposits was confirmed on kidney biopsy. No vasculitis-like signs were observed in other organs, such as lung, skin, or peripheral nerves. Afatinib was considered the cause of glomerular damage and was immediately discontinued; corticosteroids were administered. Renal function gradually recovered thereafter, with serum creatinine levels at ~ 2.3 mg/dL after second-line therapy with bevacizumab and atezolizumab. Several cases of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with other EGFR-TKIs; therefore, afatinib-induced vasculitis may lead to crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Three weeks later, the patient reported symptoms of clitoral pain, as well as a swollen, tender, and erect clitoris. These adverse effects remained for 4 days, prompting the patient to present to the emergency department where a physical exam was completed with no significant finding except as noted above. Pregabalin was immediately discontinued by the attending physician based on the probability that the swelling was likely drug-induced clitoral priapism. During follow-up, the patient continued to note clitoral erection and pain. The psychiatric pharmacist tapered off duloxetine over 2 weeks with resolution of symptoms. In an examination of the mechanism of action of both drugs, pregabalin can amplify duloxetine's inhibitory effects on voltage-dependent calcium channels. It is likely this mechanism that causes smooth muscle relaxation and led to clitoral priapism. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that pharmacological agents affecting vasoconstriction through serotonergic receptors or calcium-dependent channels can also influence clitoral erection.",2023 Jan 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a case of drug-induced clitoral priapism related to duloxetine and pregabalin, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses a case of drug-induced clitoral priapism related to duloxetine and pregabalin, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

EGPA can affect any organ system, most commonly the lungs, skin, and the nervous system. However, limb ulcers are rare complications and have only been described in few case reports. Furthermore, no documented cases of EGPA have been treated with mepolizumab. Herein, we report a case of an 86-year-old Japanese woman with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative EGPA, who had an abrupt onset of upper limb ulcers and bilateral foot drop due to multiple mononeuropathy. Clinicopathological sural nerve biopsy showed eosinophil-associated vascular damage. The patient was administered steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, vasodilators, and mepolizumab; this resulted in clinical improvement of her finger ulcers and peripheral neuropathy without any adverse effects. In cases of an abrupt onset of limb ischaemia and peripheral neuropathy, physicians should consider the possibility of EGPA as a differential diagnosis.

It is estimated that 2 million Americans suffer from opioid use disorder, and 14.5 million have alcohol use disorder, underscoring the need for medication-supported SUD treatment. The aims of this case report are 2-fold: (1) to underscore the importance of conducting a thorough medication history when considering a recent adverse drug reaction and(2) to report a novel cutaneous reaction to naltrexone oral tablet. CASE SUMMARY: A 20-year-old female with a medical history significant for bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, major depression disorder, and polysubstance use disorder experienced a drug-induced cutaneous adverse reaction on 2 separate occasions, about 3 months apart. Drug-induced adverse reactions can lead to treatment modifications, resulting in differences in efficacy and undesirable adverse effects. The purpose of this case report is to introduce naltrexone-induced skin reactions and emphasize the importance of a careful medication history when determining which medication is related to an adverse reaction. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Naltrexone will continue to be used to manage cravings related to SUD. This case brings awareness to severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with enteral naltrexone.

Immunochemotherapy treatment decisions can be affected by patients' physical ability. Because of the exclusion of patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) >/=2 from clinical trials, treatment outcome evidence in this group is limited. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 75-year-old woman with an ECOG PS of 2 admitted with respiratory symptoms and diagnosed with advanced small-cell lung cancer. After managing exacerbation of COPD and decompensated heart failure, atezolizumab with carboplatin and etoposide was administered. After 2 cycles of immunochemotherapy, deterioration of health was observed, including anemia and thrombocytopenia. Because of the good response in imaging tests and restored balance of the patient condition, immunochemotherapy was continued. After 4 cycles of combined treatment, complete regression was achieved. No another adverse effects were observed. The patient was qualified for maintenance therapy with atezolizumab. In follow-up CT scan after 2 cycles of atezolizumab, progression was observed and patient was qualified for second-line treatment. CONCLUSIONS This report presents the case of an older patient with advanced small cell lung cancer and an ECOG status of 2 who responded to combined immunochemotherapy with atezolizumab, etoposide, and carboplatin.

In the surgical population, bariatric surgery is a sustainable and attractive option. However, both obesity and surgery can independently increase the risk for venous thromboembolism and subsequent significant and even fatal adverse effects. CASE REPORT We present the unique case of a 63-year-old woman who developed substantial venous thrombosis in the postoperative period following a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Venous thrombosis following surgery is a known possible complication, but we felt that this case required reporting due to the extreme extent of thrombosis and the significant course of events that occurred following her readmission. Due to the increased thrombus burden, the patient developed phlegmasia cerulea dolens and required operative thrombectomy. With restoration of blood flow following the procedure, the patient's clinical status rapidly declined, likely due to reperfusion injury. Ultimately, she developed multisystem organ failure, which included the constellation of shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, shock liver, and, finally, cardiopulmonary arrest. CONCLUSIONS As the authors of this paper, we were especially inclined to report this particular case as the patient's clinical course was exceedingly complex due to her presenting phlegmasia cerulea dolens. The course was further complicated postoperatively by the detrimental sequelae of massive reperfusion injury, which likely eventually led to her death. We felt this pertinent to present because, after an extensive PubMed literature review, this sequence of events following gastric bypass surgery has yet to be reported in the literature.",2022 Jul 27,20220727.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to postoperative gastric bypass surgery and venous thromboembolism, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to postoperative gastric bypass surgery and venous thromboembolism, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,

Furthermore, cefiderocol pharmacokinetic (PK) data to support CNS penetration in human subjects are limited. These gaps pose a significant concern for clinicians who are faced with treating such infections when considering cefiderocol use. OBJECTIVES: To describe cefiderocol CSF and plasma PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from two different dosing regimens [2 g IV q6h (regimen 1) and 2 g IV q8h (regimen 2)] during treatment of CRAB meningitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 61-year-old woman with CRAB meningitis was treated with cefiderocol and intraventricular gentamicin. Steady-state plasma and CSF cefiderocol concentrations were evaluated on Day 19 (regimen 1) and Day 24 (regimen 2) during the cefiderocol treatment course. RESULTS: CSF AUC was 146.49 and 118.28 mg.h/L, as determined by the linear-log trapezoidal method for regimens 1 and 2, respectively. Penetration into CSF estimated as the AUCCSF/AUCfree plasma ratio was 68% and 60% for regimens 1 and 2, respectively.

In this study, we reported rare fingolimod associated cryptococcal meningitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old woman with RRMS was referred to the emergency department. The patient's major complaints were headache, fever, weakness, and progressive loss of consciousness within the last two days prior to the referral. The patient had a history of hospitalization due to RRMS [two times]. In the second hospitalization, interferon Beta-1a was replaced with Fingolimod. Using polymerase chain reaction, Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in CSF. Liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole [800 mg per day] were started. Six weeks later, the patient was discharged without any major complaints. CONCLUSION: Albeit fingolimod associated cryptococcal meningitis is a rare event, Fingolimod therapy in patients with MS should be performed cautiously. Regular follow-ups may give rise to a timely diagnosis of probable fingolimod associated cryptococcal meningitis. Fingolimod therapy can lead to lymphocytopenia and various infections.

Therefore, new types of side effects may be overlooked or underestimated. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell-engager (BiTE) antibody with specificity for CD19 on B cells and CD3 on T cells. Neurological events, such as neuropathy and encephalopathy, are serious side effects of BiTE antibodies. We encountered a case of a 62-year-old woman who experienced short-term memory impairment and dysgraphia after the first blinatumomab administration for Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The CTCAE does not include dysgraphia as a classifier for antibody therapies, such as blinatumomab, and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, which is defined as a Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy-related toxicity; dysgraphia is included in the list of symptoms but is not graded. In this case, the severity of dysgraphia differed depending on the complexity of the letters examined. There is no report that the severity of dysgraphia depends on the letters' complexity, and therefore, it may be overlooked when using simple letters. We have reported the characteristics of dysgraphia in this case and the differences observed when judging different letters.",2022 May 29,20220529.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it discusses side effects of blinatumomab, a cancer treatment.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it discusses side effects of blinatumomab, a cancer treatment.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of dysgraphia as a side effect of blinatumomab treatment, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of dysgraphia as a side effect of blinatumomab treatment, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,90,,
35702931,,Alogliptin Induced Stomatitis: An Adverse Drug Event Case Report.,Terry D||Eads AV,"Background: Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are commonly used agents to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although generally well tolerated, stomatitis has been previously reported as an adverse event with sitagliptin and linagliptin. Stomatitis with alogliptin has not been reported in post-marketing data to date. Objective: To report a case of suspected drug-induced stomatitis in a patient who received alogliptin for T2DM which resolved upon discontinuation of the offending agent. Summary: A 60-year-old male with T2DM began treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor, alogliptin. After 4 doses of alogliptin, the patient reported inflammation and irritation along the lateral borders of his tongue, along with open fissures and oral ulcerations on the dorsal surface of the mucosa. He was subsequently diagnosed with stomatitis. Patient discontinued alogliptin and reported improvement in symptoms within 48 hours. Lesions re-epithelialized within 4 weeks after cessation of alogliptin. The Naranjo Algorithm was used to assess causality. The total score was 7, which when interpreted, implicates alogliptin as a ""probable"" cause of the reaction.

35477705,PMC9063586,Use of Lithium in Hyperthyroidism Secondary to Graves' Disease: A Case Report.,Sharma PP,"BACKGROUND The therapeutic approach to Graves' disease (GD) comprises thionamides, radioiodine ablation, or surgery as first-line therapy, and cholestyramine and oral iodine as second-line therapies. The role of lithium (Li) in GD as a primary or adjunctive therapy remains contentious. We present a case of GD managed by Li therapy with oral iodine solution. CASE REPORT A 26-year-old man, admitted with acute blast crisis secondary to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), reported palpitations, 40-lb weight loss, heat intolerance, and fatigue. An examination revealed sinus tachycardia, elevated body temperature, and thyromegaly. Laboratory evaluation confirmed hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.005 mcIU/l, FT4 5.57 ng/dl, TT3 629 ng/dl) secondary to GD (TRAb >40 IU/l, TSIg 178%). Thionamides and surgery were contraindicated due to pancytopenia from a blast crisis. Inability to maintain post-radiation precautions precluded use of RAI. Cholestyramine was attempted and discontinued due to nausea. We introduced oral Li carbonate with oral iodine, which the patient tolerated. Thyroid functions improved with therapy (TSH 0.007 mcIU/l, FT4 0.82 ng/dl, TT3 122 ng/dl) with stable Li level (0.5-0.8 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS Li inhibits iodine uptake through interference with sodium-iodide symporter and tyrosine iodination, thyroglobulin structure changes, peripheral deiodinase blockage, and preventing TSH and TSIg stimulation. Our case shows that a low therapeutic level of Li, in combination with oral iodine, can suppress thyroid overactivity without adverse effects. We suggest that low-dose Li carbonate is a safe and effective adjunctive antithyroid medication to be considered if primary therapies for hyperthyroidism are unavailable.",2022 Apr 28,20220428.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article discusses the use of lithium in treating hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves' disease and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, making it irrelevant to the specified criteria."", 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of lithium in treating hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves' disease and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, making it irrelevant to the specified criteria.",2,95,,

A CASE REPORT.,Pencak M||Veith M,"AIM: To present the case of a patient with myopic choroidal neovascular membrane (mCNV) in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, who was treated with intravitreal ranibizumab. CASE REPORT: The 34-year-old patient was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady in January 2020 for mCNV on her right eye (RE). The patient was in the 34th week of pregnancy. Initial best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 68 ETDRS letters. Spherical equivalent of the RE was -11.5 dioptres, axial length of the RE was 27.7 mm. Pigmented CNV with small haemorrhage was present on the retina of the RE. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the RE showed a hyperreflective mass above the retinal pigment epithelium, central retinal thickness (CRT) was 310 microm. OCT angiography confirmed the presence of a classic CNV in the macula of the RE. Two weeks later, the hyperreflective lesion and oedema in the macula of the RE increased, the CRT was 329 microm, BCVA remained stable. After discussion with the patient and the treating gynaecologist, intravitreal ranibizumab was administered in the RE in the 36th week of pregnancy. On check-up 3 weeks later, we observed the decrease of macular oedema to 276 microm and the improvement of BCVA to 78 ETDRS letters. The patient delivered a healthy baby girl in the 39th week of pregnancy via caesarean section, postnatal adaptation of the newborn was normal. During further visits, the BCVA improved to 83 ETDRS letters and the macular oedema disappeared completely. 8 months after the first ranibizumab injection, the CNV reactivated, BCVA decreased to 72 ETDRS letters, oedema was present in the macula and the CRT was 309 microm. Another ranibizumab was administered into the RE. The patient then discovered that she was pregnant; according to calculations, she was in the 3rd week of pregnancy at the time of the second ranibizumab injection. After the second injection, BCVA improved to 79 ETDRS letters, macular oedema on the OCT disappeared and CRT decreased to 264 microm. The pregnancy was terminated per patients request. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal administration of ranibizumab in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy led to the improvement of BCVA and decrease of macular oedema in the patient with mCNV. The injection had no adverse effect on the pregnancy or the postnatal adaptation of the newborn. However, it is always necessary to consider the risk/benefit ratio when administering intravitreal antiVEGF drugs in pregnant patients.

The frequent adverse reactions of capecitabine mainly include gastrointestinal side effects, anemia, and cardiovascular toxicity. Here, we report a rare case of severe hyperglycemia and hypokalemia during long-term treatment with capecitabine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old Chinese female was hospitalized with the complaint of breathlessness and weakness after activity, for 1 month. Her past history is significant for a diagnosis of right-sided breast cancer 7 years ago. She underwent right mastectomy, following which capecitabine was started 1.5 years prior to the current admission as part of her primary treatment at the discovery of systemic osseous metastasis. Her fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were quite normal 7 months ago but increased to 15.3 mmol/L and 11.2%, respectively, at the present admission. Her serum potassium level was as low as 2.5 mmol/L. Plasma autoantibodies related to islets and insulin were all negative. Capecitabine was discontinued, and an insulin pump and potassium supplement were given after admission. Her blood sugar and potassium levels returned to their normal ranges soon. Self-injection of insulin was withdrawn completely at 2 months after discharge, and no oral hypoglycemic agents were added.

It usually occurs in patients with metformin overdose or in those with underlying acute and/or chronic conditions resulting in impaired lactate metabolism. Among these, patients with acute kidney injury, heart failure, sepsis, and cirrhosis are the most vulnerable to MALA, even in the setting of appropriate therapy. The most common symptoms of MALA include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy, hypothermia, respiratory failure, and hypotension. Blindness is a dramatic symptom that has been rarely reported with MALA. CASE REPORT We report a case of 78-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy for which she was treated with metformin and insulin. She developed nausea, non-bloody emesis, and watery diarrhea, which led to dehydration, anion gap metabolic acidosis due to hyperlactatemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She was hospitalized for i.v. hydration and further management when she suddenly developed blindness. The diagnostic work-up ruled out central causes and her symptoms resolved briefly after continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated, confirming the diagnosis of MALA. CONCLUSIONS By reporting this case, we wish to increase awareness about MALA symptoms, its diagnosis, and the importance of early recognition and initiation of treatment among clinicians involved in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who take metformin for diabetes mellitus.

Repeated iron infusions may lead to prolonged hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia events not captured by RCTs. Several previous case reports have described skeletal adverse effects after repeated iron infusions. To characterize these effects, we conducted a systematic review of case reports. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched in March 2021. We selected case reports of patients >/=16 years old. Study quality was assessed using the tool from Murad and colleagues. We report the results in a narrative summary. We identified 28 case reports, reporting 30 cases. Ages ranged from 28 to 80 years (median 50 years). Most patients (n = 18) received ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), whereas 8 received saccharated ferric oxide (SFO) and 3 received iron polymaltose (IPM). All but 2 cases had more than five infusions (range 2 to 198, median 17). The lowest phosphate levels ranged from 0.16 to 0.77 mmol/L (median 0.36 mmol/L). Intact FGF-23 (iFGF-23) was high when measured. Serum 25OH vitamin D was low in 10 of 21 cases measured and 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D in 12 of 18. Alkaline phosphatase was high in 18 of 22 cases. Bone or muscle pain was reported in 28 of the 30 cases. Twenty patients had pseudofractures, 9 had fractures, and 6 patients had both. All 15 available bone scans showed focal isotope uptake. Case reports tend to report severe cases, so potential reporting bias should be considered. Osteomalacia is a potential complication of repeated iron infusion, especially in patients with gastrointestinal disorders receiving prolonged therapy. Pain and fractures or pseudofractures are common clinical findings, associated with low phosphate, high iFGF-23, high alkaline phosphatase, and abnormal isotope bone scan. Discontinuing or switching the iron formulation was an effective intervention in most cases. (c) 2022 The Authors.

However, the patient developed CRS after pembrolizumab initiation and presented with fever, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Blood tests showed elevated levels of peripheral CD8+ T cells, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The symptoms rapidly improved after corticosteroid initiation. Based on the present case, we propose that pembrolizumab might be a potential salvage therapy for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC after EGFR-TKI resistance; CRS would be a sign of the antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibitors in those patients. However, CRS can be a fatal adverse effect and clinicians must remain vigilant for the rare toxicities to make prompt diagnosis and treatment.",2022 May,20220405.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as an adverse effect related to pembrolizumab therapy in lung cancer, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as an adverse effect related to pembrolizumab therapy in lung cancer, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
35380159,,Eravacycline infusion-related hypoesthesia: A case report.,Miller RB||McClure KM||Stewart RG||Shealy SC||Brown K||Bookstaver PB,"PURPOSE: Eravacycline (ERV) is often used for drug-resistant gram-negative and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections, but infusion site reactions are a potential adverse effect. We report a case of severe hypoesthesia secondary to ERV infusion. SUMMARY: A 74-year-old man presented with dyspnea, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis after being treated for community-acquired pneumonia. On the basis of respiratory cultures performed several weeks before the index hospitalization, he was diagnosed with Mycobacterium chelonae pneumonia. On hospital day (HD) 2, the infectious diseases consult team, guided by susceptibilities, initiated a regimen of azithromycin, levofloxacin, and ERV 80 mg (1 mg/kg) intravenously every 12 hours infused over 1 hour in 250 mL of normal saline. Approximately 25 minutes after the ERV infusion began, the patient reported tingling and numbness in his fingers, hands, and mouth, with shooting pain in his head. Symptoms resolved with cessation of the ERV infusion. On HD 3, the same ERV dose and volume was administered with an extended infusion time of 2 hours. The patient experienced the same reaction after 58 minutes, which ceased shortly after the infusion was stopped. Use of ERV was subsequently discontinued. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score was 9, indicating a definite reaction. A review of the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System through March 2021 identified 22 ERV-associated events. Among these, 18% appear to be related to ERV infusions. Published results from phase 3 clinical trials did not document any hypoesthesia. It is unknown whether there is a correlation between concentration, dose, or infusion time and associated reactions. CONCLUSION: This is a unique case of severe hypoesthesia secondary to ERV infusion leading to drug discontinuation. More data are needed to determine effective mitigation strategies.",2022 Jul 8,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.

35319323,PMC8956318,Predicting transdermal fentanyl delivery using physics-based simulations for tailored therapy based on the age.,Bahrami F||Rossi RM||Defraeye T,"Transdermal fentanyl patches are an effective alternative to the sustained release of oral morphine for chronic pain management. Due to the narrow therapeutic range of fentanyl, the concentration of fentanyl in the blood needs to be carefully monitored. Only then can effective pain relief be achieved while avoiding adverse effects such as respiratory depression. This study developed a physics-based digital twin of a patient by implementing drug uptake, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics models. The twin was employed to predict the in-silico effect of conventional fentanyl transdermal in a 20-80-year-old virtual patient. The results show that, with increasing age, the maximum transdermal fentanyl flux and maximum concentration of fentanyl in the blood decreased by 11.4% and 7.0%, respectively. However, the results also show that as the patient's age increases, the pain relief increases by 45.2%. Furthermore, the digital twin was used to propose a tailored therapy based on the patient's age. This predesigned therapy customized the duration of applying the commercialized fentanyl patches. According to this therapy, a 20-year-old patient needs to change the patch 2.1 times more frequently than conventional therapy, which leads to 30% more pain relief and 315% more time without pain. In addition, the digital twin was updated by the patient's pain intensity feedback. Such therapy increased the patient's breathing rate while providing effective pain relief, so a safer treatment. We quantified the added value of a patient's physics-based digital twin and sketched the future roadmap for implementing such twin-assisted treatment into the clinics.",2022 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on fentanyl patches and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on fentanyl patches and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of physics-based simulations for predicting fentanyl delivery and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of physics-based simulations for predicting fentanyl delivery and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
35317840,PMC8941771,Metallosis following hip arthroplasty: two case reports.,Mastel M||Boisvert A||Moore R||Sutherland F||Powell J,"BACKGROUND: There has been increasing recognition of local and systemic adverse events associated with the release of metal ions and nanoparticles from hip arthroplasty components. Adverse local tissue reactions to metal ion debris can include periprosthetic solid and cystic masses known as pseudotumors. These masses can result in pain, swelling, extensive destruction to surrounding hip soft-tissues, and compression syndromes on neurovascular, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary structures. As reports of pseudotumors requiring multidisciplinary excision are limited, we present two pseudotumor cases that were excised through a combined approach. CASE PRESENTATIONS: The first case involves a 60-year-old Caucasian female with a large pseudotumor with intrapelvic and vascular involvement associated with a metal-on-polyethylene total hip arthroplasty, excised with contributions from general surgery, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. Pseudotumor excision was followed by a revision total hip reconstruction in addition to an abductor mechanism reconstruction with tendo-Achilles allograft. The second case is that of a 64-year-old Caucasian female with a pseudotumor in close relationship to the femoral vessels following a metal-on-metal hip resurfacing, excised with a combination of vascular surgery and orthopedic surgery, with subsequent revision total hip reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a lack of literature to support the extensiveness of pseudotumor excision required in complex cases with significant intrapelvic or vascular involvement. Given the potential for significant adverse effects of large masses, the authors' preference is to involve a multidisciplinary team to achieve a more comprehensive excision while minimizing the risk of potential complications.",2022 Mar 23,20220323.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on complications of hip arthroplasty and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on complications of hip arthroplasty and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to metal ion release and pseudotumors following hip arthroplasty, which is unrelated to vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to metal ion release and pseudotumors following hip arthroplasty, which is unrelated to vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

Until now, more than 4.7 billion persons have been vaccinated around the world, and adverse effects not observed in pre-authorization trials are being reported at low frequency. METHODS: We report a case of severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) after SARS-CoV-2 immunization and performed a literature search for all reported cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated HLH. RESULTS: A 24-year-old female developed HLH after immunization with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty.

The patient was initially treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) and dexamethasone without response. The addition of the human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist Anakinra resulted in full recovery within 6 weeks after vaccination. A literature search revealed 15 additional cases of HLH after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, the majority after immunization with Comirnaty (n = 7) or the viral vector vaccine Vaxzevria (n = 6).

35152911,PMC8842808,Nivolumab-related myasthenia gravis with myositis requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation: a case report.,Saishu Y||Yoshida T||Seino Y||Nomura T,"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks inhibitors of T-cell activation and blunts antitumor immunity and is used in the treatment of various cancers. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors have immune-related adverse effects on various organs due to promoting T-cell activity against host tissues by blocking inhibition of T-cell function. Although immune-related adverse effects including hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, nephritis, endocrinopathies, and hypophysitis are well recognized with established treatment guidelines, neuromuscular immune-related adverse effects are rare phenomena. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Asian (Japanese) woman was diagnosed with nivolumab-related myasthenia gravis with myositis and myocarditis. She had a past history of thymectomy for large thymoma with a high anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody level without any symptoms. Nivolumab was administered for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Creatine kinase levels began to rise 2 weeks after the administration, and abnormal neurological findings appeared 3 weeks after the administration. Ventricular arrhythmia, wide QRS complex, and dyssynchrony of the left ventricle also appeared. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were administered, and plasma exchange was performed. The patient required intensive care and prolonged mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy owing to weakness of the diaphragm; she was eventually weaned from the ventilator and discharged. Diaphragm ultrasound was used for the decision-making of the weaning strategy and evaluation of the diaphragmatic function. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab-induced severe myasthenia gravis with myositis and myocarditis required intensive care and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Although immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myasthenia gravis is a rare adverse event, appropriate and prompt treatment is required because of its severity and rapid progression. Diaphragm ultrasound was useful not only in diagnosing diaphragm dysfunction and deciding the strategy for weaning from mechanical ventilation but also in evaluating the recovery of the diaphragmatic function.",2022 Feb 14,20220214.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; it focuses on adverse effects of a cancer medication.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; it focuses on adverse effects of a cancer medication.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and its adverse effects, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and its adverse effects, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

In this study, intradiscal pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) was performed in a patient with discogenic low back pain who did not respond to oral medication, posterior medial branch block, epidural steroid injection, and percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 28-year-old woman visited a pain clinic complaining of low back pain that was scored 8 out of 10 on a numerical rating scale. Her pain was present in any position throughout the day and worsened in the sitting position. DIAGNOSES: Magnetic resonance imaging showed L5-S1 internal discal disruption. Based on the medical history, physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging, we determined that her pain originated from the L5-S1 disc. INTERVENTIONS: We performed an intradiscal PRF on the affected disc under C-arm fluoroscopy guidance. PRF was performed at 5 Hz, 20-ms pulse width, and 70 V for 15 minutes while ensuring that the electrode tip temperature was maintained below 42 degrees C. OUTCOMES: Immediately after the procedure, the patient's pain subsided. At the 1-month follow-up visit, the patient reported complete relief of her low back pain. The Oswestry disability index, which indicates the degree of disability, improved significantly. She also reported that she could sit for long periods because the pain was reduced.

However, we have found that topically applied melatonin, a product that to our knowledge is not commercially available in Spain, is safe and effective in the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis and a viable substitute for corticosteroid therapy. In this report, we describe the use of compounded melatonin in Beeler cream (the formulation for which is provided) in a 46-year-old woman who underwent surgery and radiotherapy for early stage adenocarcinoma of the breast. The patient applied that cream as directed throughout the prescribed course of radiotherapy and continued its use for 3 weeks after she last underwent irradiation. She experienced no adverse effects from the use of the compounded formulation and tolerated that treatment well. Radiation dermatitis did not develop at the irradiated site until approximately 1 week after the final radiotherapy session, at which time mild erythema of the treated skin emerged. That condition, which was successfully treated by application of the melatonin-containing cream as previously prescribed, resolved after 3 weeks of its use.

35008135,,Platelet Anti-Aggregator Drowns the Heart.,Siddiqui MU||Siddiqui MD||Hameed S||Naeem Z||Siddiqui M,"BACKGROUND: Anagrelide is a drug used for treatment of essential thrombocytosis especially when conventional therapy is insufficient. Adverse effects associated with anagrelide are palpitation, liver toxicity, renal failure and in few cases pericardial effusion. We here report a rare case of anagrelide induced pericardial effusion. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and myeloproliferative disorder presented to the emergency department with dyspnea on rest and exertion. He was initially treated with hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis but was later switched to anagrelide. On examination patient had muffled heart sounds. Lab investigations identified hyperkalemia and transaminitis. Transthoracic echocardiogram identified a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The pericardial effusion and transaminitis were attributed to anagrelide toxicity as other causes were ruled out. Pericardiocentesis was performed and anagrelide was discontinued. Patient was discharged in a well-compensated state with outpatient follow-up in two to three weeks. CONCLUSION: Anagrelide is considered to be very effective treatment for essential thrombocytosis. It is, however, associated with serious adverse effects such as pericardial effusion, liver toxicity and palpitations.

The size of the tumors vary, ranging from 0.6 cm to 25.5 cm, with a median size of 6.8 cm. CASE REPORT We report a case of a giant GIST (25x18x8.5 cm) in an 83-year-old woman, which we believe is the largest reported GIST, in Borneo, Malaysia. She presented with gradually increasing abdominal distension with occasional discomfort on movement for 1 month. Computed tomography revealed a large multilobulated enhancing mass measuring 10x20x22 cm with no clear plane with the posterior gastric wall, duodenum, and pancreas. We performed a distal gastrectomy and transverse colon segmentectomy, as the tumor was plastered to the mesentery of the transverse colon. Despite extensive surgery, she recovered well after surgery. Due to her advanced age and the tumor size, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was not given owing to the possibility of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS The management of GIST is complicated, especially for a huge GIST with local invasion. Despite the benefits of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, the role of surgery in managing GIST is crucial, especially for patients with huge tumor size, advanced age, and local complications from the tumor.",2022 Jan 7,20220107.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on gastrointestinal stromal tumors and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on gastrointestinal stromal tumors and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

We present a structured review based on two case reports of GBSfCV19v, a systematic review, and Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) analysis to estimate the risk and describe the clinical characteristics (CC) of these events. We've searched on MEDLINE and Embase, from the inception to May 20, 2021, using the keywords: ""Guillain barre syndrome"" and cross-referenced with ""covid-19 vaccines."" We estimated the risk of GBSfCV19v, comparing it with the risk of GBS following the influenza vaccine (GBSfIv), considering the VAERS sensitivity. The clinical characteristics included: age, sex, comorbidities, type of vaccine, administered dose, clinical onset, deaths, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and electromyography (EMG) pattern. We found 43 cases, considering the risk of GBSfCV19v lower than GBSfIv (160-320 cases). The patients had a mean age of 54 years and 23 (56%) were male. The types of vaccines used: Pfizer (22), Moderna (9), AstraZeneca (3), Janssen (3), and Johnson & Johnson (1). 24 cases of GBS occurred after the first dose, with clinical onset of 7 days. CSF albuminocytological dissociation was reported in 7 patients, and EMG revealed a predominant demyelinating pattern.

This case study assessed zolpidem concentrations in the cord blood and breast milk and ramelteon concentrations in the breast milk of a woman who was treated with zolpidem and ramelteon for insomnia. Materials and Methods: Zolpidem concentrations were measured in maternal serum, breast milk, and cord blood. Concentrations of ramelteon and M-II, an active ramelteon metabolite, were measured in maternal serum and breast milk. Case Report: A 46-year-old female patient diagnosed with insomnia received 5-10 mg/day zolpidem during pregnancy and lactation and 8 mg/day ramelteon during lactation. A male infant weighing 3,329 g was born at 38 weeks' gestation, with no congenital abnormalities found during pregnancy or at birth. The infant was normal at the 1-month postpartum checkup. The maternal/placental ratio of zolpidem concentrations was 0.1 at 7.4 hours after maternal dosing, similar to that reported in previous studies. The calculated relative infant dose through breast milk based on the maximum drug concentration in breast milk at 2.2 hours after maternal dosing was 2.7% for zolpidem and 0.2% for ramelteon. Ramelteon and its metabolite (M-II) concentrations in the breast milk were equivalent to those in the maternal serum, although the infant exposure of these drugs was low for an oral dose. Conclusions: In the current case, zolpidem transferred into the placenta and breast milk, and ramelteon transferred into the breast milk.

34882600,,Case Report: Erdafitinib-induced Central Serous Chorioretinopathy.,Claiborne RT||Tsan GL,"SIGNIFICANCE: Erdafitinib is the first fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2019 for the treatment of locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Central serous chorioretinopathy is a common ocular adverse effect requiring frequent monitoring with ophthalmic examination. PURPOSE: This study aimed to increase awareness of erdafitinib-induced central serous chorioretinopathy, highlight erdafitinib dose management guidelines, and emphasize the importance of collaborating with oncologists to prevent adverse visual consequences. CASE REPORT: An 80-year-old patient with an advanced urothelial cancer with fibroblast growth factor receptor mutations developed central serous chorioretinopathy when he was treated with daily 8 mg of erdafitinib. The erdafitinib-induced central serous chorioretinopathy resolved completely after the discontinuation of erdafitinib. He was then treated with daily 6 mg of erdafitinib and again developed central serous chorioretinopathy, which resolved completely upon discontinuation of the medication. The patient then decided to stop treatment with erdafitinib. CONCLUSIONS: Erdafitinib, a potent tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 to 4, demonstrates antitumor activity in advanced urothelial carcinoma with fibroblast growth factor receptor mutations with a response rate of approximately 40%. However, central serous chorioretinopathy develops in 25% of patients treated with a daily 8-mg dose of erdafitinib. Although most mild to moderate erdafitinib-induced central serous chorioretinopathies resolve with dose interruption or reduction, occasionally discontinuation of the medication is necessary. Therefore, careful coordination with oncologists is important to assess the impact of erdafitinib on vision, quality of life, and survival prognosis.",2022 Jan 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the adverse effects of a cancer medication.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the adverse effects of a cancer medication.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of erdafitinib, specifically central serous chorioretinopathy, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of erdafitinib, specifically central serous chorioretinopathy, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus, are widely used in the management of transplant patients and are associated with the development of hyperkalaemia. We report on 10 renal transplant patients, treated with fludrocortisone, following identification of hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis. RESULTS: All 10 patients were male aged (mean +/- SD) 53.0 +/- 13.2 years; 7 were Caucasian and 3 South Asian. Before and after fludrocortisone administration, respective (mean +/- SD) serum potassium was 6.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/L and 5.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (p = 0.0002); serum bicarbonate 18.5 +/- 1.6 mmol/L and 20.5 +/- 2.3 mmol/L (p = 0.002); serum sodium 135 +/- 4.6 mmol/L and 137 +/- 2.2 mmol/L (p = 0.0728); serum creatinine 181 +/- 61 mumol/L and 168 +/- 64 mumol/L (p = 0.1318); eGFR 42 +/- 18 mL/min and 46 +/- 18 mL/min (p = 0.0303); blood tacrolimus 10.1 +/- 2.9 ng/mL and 10.4 +/- 1.4 ng/mL (p = 0.7975); and blood pressure 129 +/- 15/79 +/- 25 mm Hg and 126 +/- 24/75 +/- 7 mm Hg.

Following fludrocortisone, no patients had hyperkalaemia requiring inpatient management. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis in transplant patients on tacrolimus with low-dose fludrocortisone resulted in rapid correction of hyperkalaemia and acidosis without significant effects on blood pressure or serum sodium.

The most common ophthalmic side effects are eyelid edema and periorbital edema. Other side effects which occur at rates of <1% include blepharitis, blurred vision, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, retinal hemorrhage, etc. An uncommon case is here reported of a 51-year-old male with chronic myeloid leukemia who developed vitreous hemorrhage due to imatinib after 9 months of treatment. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old male with leukocytosis detected in the blood test examination was referred to the Hematology Department. The bone marrow biopsy result was compatible with chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib treatment (400 mg/day) was started. In the ninth month of imatinib treatment, the patient complained of a sudden decrease in vision. Vitreous hemorrhage was detected in the left eye and the patient underwent surgery. Vitreous hemorrhage recurred 1 month after the operation. On the fourth day after the discontinuation of imatinib treatment, the patient's ophthalmic complaints improved significantly. The Naranjo algorithm was applied and a score of 9 was detected. The vitreous hemorrhage of the patient was attributed to imatinib, and so the treatment of the patient was switched to bosutinib. DISCUSSION: Imatinib is an oral signal inhibitor that targets tyrosine kinase for BCR/ABL, platelet-derived growth factor, stem cell factor, and c-kit (CD117). The conjunctiva and sclera have a large amount of c-kit positive mast cells which are inhibited by imatinib.

34664838,PMC8447983,Pregnancy confirmed after controlled ovarian stimulation for infertility: A case report.,Jiang M||Wang C||Fei X||Lin Z,"RATIONAL: Induction of ovarian stimulation by use of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) long protocol in the luteal phase is a common practice and results in stable pregnancy and live births; it is often used in patients with normal ovarian function. Some patients with normal ovulation may be pregnant before ovulation induction, which can be easily confirmed by asking the patient about cessation of menstruation. However, some pregnancy complications may cause vaginal bleeding along with normal menstrual blood loss; in such a situation, hormone levels can often mirror that seen in pituitary down-regulation and the value of beta-HCG may be less than 5 mIU/mL. Under these conditions, the physician might start the cycle of ovarian stimulation. During ovarian stimulation, the increase in beta-HCG can cause premature luteinization and follicle maturation disorder, and poor embryo quality, which can easily be overlooked. In this study, we report a case of pregnancy at the end of controlled ovarian stimulation induced by GnRHa long protocol in the luteal phase, followed by follicle maturation disorder and poor embryo quality. This case provided a reference and served as a cautionary note that could perhaps obviate occurrence of similar cases. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 30-year-old woman with a diagnosis of unexplained infertility was scheduled for in vitro fertilization embryo culture (IVF) at our clinic. Pregnancy was confirmed at the end of controlled ovarian stimulation, which was followed by follicular maturation disorder and poor embryo quality. DIAGNOSIS: The patient with a diagnosis of unexplained infertility was scheduled for IVF at our clinic. INTERVENTIONS: Oocyte retrieval was still arranged for her after confirmation of pregnancy. As per the beta-HCG level and the trans-vaginal ultrasound examination findings, we considered 2 possibilities: an adverse intrauterine pregnancy or extra-uterine pregnancy. Therefore, we decided to terminate the pregnancy; hence, 50 mg/d of mifepristone was given for 2 days, combined with 200 mug misoprostol. OUTCOMES: Elevated beta-HCG level had an adverse effect on maturation and fertilization of oocytes, and even embryo quality. CONCLUSION: Once pregnancy is confirmed, ovulation induction should be terminated as soon as possible.",2021 Sep 17,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to pregnancy and ovarian stimulation, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to pregnancy and ovarian stimulation, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

The adverse effects of EGFR-TKIs are generally less severe than those of conventional cytotoxic therapies. We report a patient with NSCLC who presented with acute kidney injury associated with biopsy-proven acute tubular injury during osimertinib treatment and whose renal function recovered after reducing the osimertinib dose. A 61-year-old male smoker complained of dyspnoea on exertion for 1 month before his visit to the medical centre. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe (cT4N3M1a, stage IVA) and was positive for an EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion). Osimertinib was initiated at 80 mg/day. At treatment initiation, the patient's serum creatinine level was 0.64 mg/dL, with microscopic haematuria; by day 83, this level had increased to 1.33 mg/dL, with proteinuria. On day 83, we reduced the osimertinib dose to 40 mg/day and performed a kidney biopsy on day 98. The histological diagnosis was tubular injury with IgA deposition. Based on the clinical course and histological findings, we speculated that the kidney injury was associated with osimertinib. After dose reduction, the patient's serum creatinine level decreased to 1.07 mg/dL, and proteinuria disappeared. He maintained a partial response for >6 months after osimertinib administration.

We describe the case of an elderly woman with bladder carcinoma who experienced two episodes of generalized seizures after treatment with pembrolizumab. The episodes were atypical of encephalitis, because the seizures were completely responsive to AEDs and the CSF parameters normalized completely without immunotherapy. Since interictal EEG revealed persistent epileptic discharges after the seizures, pembrolizumab was considered to have induced a chronic state of epileptogenicity as the possible pathology, with a clinical picture similar to that of autoimmune epilepsy.

A 58-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer was admitted to the emergency room (ER) due to severe chest pain after treatment with CAP (Xeloda). The blood sample showed separation of blood and lipids, and the lipid profile revealed rapidly increased triglyceride and cholesterol levels. After fenofibrate therapy was administered, the patient's symptoms were relieved, and the repeat lipid test was normalized. Other causes of hyperlipidemia were carefully excluded, considering that the severe adverse effects of CAP had since abated. The earliest onset of the incidence as far as we know, the symptom of angina at the same time with CIHT, and distinct blood-lipid layer in blood sample all suggest the rarity of this case.

However, opioids have several well-known clinical adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, respiratory depression and drowsiness. Endocrine dysfunctions are also opioid-induced adverse effects but remain under-diagnosed in clinical settings, especially opioid-induced adrenal insufficiency (OIAI). A 46-year-old woman was treated with transdermal fentanyl at a dose of 90-120 mg daily morphine milligram equivalent for non-malignant chronic pain for four years. Fatigue, loss of appetite and decrease in vitality began about two years after starting fentanyl. Subsequently, constipation and abdominal pain appeared and became worse, which led to suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. Clinical diagnosis of OIAI was established based on laboratory findings of secondary adrenal insufficiency, including corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, clinical history of long-term fentanyl use, and exclusion of other hypothalamic-pituitary diseases. Oral corticosteroid replacement therapy was unable to relieve her abdominal pain and constipation; opioid-rotation and dose-reduction of fentanyl were not feasible because of her persistent pain and severe anxiety. While her clinical course clearly suggested that long-term, relatively high-dose transdermal fentanyl treatment may have contributed to the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency, the symptoms associated with OIAI are generally non-specific and complex. Together with under-recognition of OIAI as a clinical entity, the non-specific, wide range of symptoms can impede prompt diagnosis.

34411009,,Switching to Intranasal Esketamine Maintains the Antidepressant Response to Intravenous Racemic Ketamine Administration: A Case Series of 10 Patients.,Banov MD||Landrum RE||Moore MB||Szabo ST,"PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal (IN) esketamine as maintenance antidepressant therapy in patients who have demonstrated clinical improvement with off-label intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 10 consecutive outpatients with TRD who all had a clinically meaningful response when treated with IV racemic ketamine and were then switched to IN esketamine for maintenance therapy. Patient outcomes were assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale at each visit. Adverse effects were assessed at each treatment. FINDINGS: Results indicated that 9 patients either maintained the benefit or showed greater improvement when transitioned to IN esketamine for antidepressant maintenance therapy. One patient had worsening of depression due to an acute psychosocial stressor but still improved from baseline IV racemic ketamine treatment. Six patients returned to work or pursued employment, and 4 patients with suicidal ideation remitted during IV racemic ketamine treatment and had no recurrence of suicidality with IN esketamine. No serious adverse reactions or tolerability issues were observed. IMPLICATIONS: This case series reports the outcomes of 10 severely ill patients with TRD who had a clinically meaningful response to IV racemic ketamine and demonstrated a maintenance of effect or continued improvement when transitioned to IN esketamine. Although this finding needs to be replicated in larger, controlled studies, this report provides promising results for patients who have safely and effectively switched to Food and Drug Administration-approved IN esketamine after receiving acute or maintenance depression treatment with off-label IV racemic ketamine.",2021 Sep-Oct 01,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the use of esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the use of esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for maintenance therapy in treatment-resistant depression, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for maintenance therapy in treatment-resistant depression, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,

The underlying cause remains to be definitively established; however, several drugs have been linked to this uncommon clinical entity. We present a rare case of eosinophilic fasciitis secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old woman with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma presented to the rheumatology clinic for evaluation of joint pain that developed 3 weeks after beginning treatment with cemiplimab. The correlation of clinical history and physical examination was most consistent with osteoarthritis. Symptoms improved after a short course of low-dose prednisone. The patient continued cemiplimab therapy for approximately 1 year and was subsequently transitioned to carboplatin and radiation therapy. However, relapse occurred shortly thereafter, and cemiplimab was restarted. Two weeks later, the patient developed severe joint pain, morning stiffness, and extensive cutaneous discoloration and induration. A skin biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination of a tissue sample showed a mononuclear infiltrate with plasma cells and eosinophils. A diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was established. Cemiplimab was held and the patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, and sulfasalazine. Symptoms improved within 1 week. CONCLUSIONS Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare but important adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Individuals receiving immunotherapy should be monitored closely for symptoms of eosinophilic fasciitis, as prompt treatment is essential to prevent long-term complications.",2021 Aug 17,20210817.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses eosinophilic fasciitis as an adverse effect of cemiplimab therapy, not COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses eosinophilic fasciitis as an adverse effect of cemiplimab therapy, not COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

34397832,PMC8341247,Successful treatment of restless leg syndrome with the traditional herbal medicines Dangguijakyak-san and Shihogyeji-tang: A case report (CARE-compliant).,Seo Y||Jin C||Jang BH||Jeon JP||Lee YS||Yang SB||Jung WS||Moon SK||Cho KH||Kwon S,"RATIONALE: Dopamine replacement is currently the standard treatment for restless leg syndrome (RLS); however, various adverse effects are associated with long-term therapy, and the benefits disappear upon discontinuation. To overcome these limitations, interest in traditional East Asian medicine has increased. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 72-year-old Asian woman originally admitted for an intracerebral hemorrhage presented with complaints of an unpleasant sensation throughout the body that appeared at night. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with chronic persistent RLS based on the 2012 Revised International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group Diagnostic Criteria. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with extracts of the traditional herbal medicines Dangguijakyak-san (DS) and Shihogyeji-tang (ST). After 47 days of therapy, all herbal medicines were discontinued, and symptoms had not returned by the last follow-up 244 days after the initial treatment. OUTCOMES: One week after initiating herbal treatment with DS and ST, the RLS symptoms began to improve, and the total hours of sleep had increased from 2 to 9 hours by day 21, with a Korean version of the international restless legs scale score of 11 points. On day 36, ST was discontinued, given the continued improvement of symptoms. On day 47, symptoms had disappeared (Korean version of the international restless legs scale score: 0), and sleep disturbances caused by RLS had completely resolved. After day 47, DS was also discontinued. There were no adverse effects associated with the administration of DS and ST, and the symptoms had not recurred by the last follow-up on day 244. LESSONS: In this case, RLS related symptoms, which had been present for approximately 60 years, were improved using only the traditional herbal medicines DS and ST (without dopamine replacement), and no symptoms recurred for 244 days. This case suggests that if replacement therapy is difficult or not desired, herbal medicinal therapies may be an effective alternative. This also suggests that the effect of herbal medicine on RLS might be semi-permanent. Further investigations, including clinical trials, are needed to confirm these effects.",2021 Aug 6,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the treatment of restless leg syndrome using herbal medicine, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on the treatment of restless leg syndrome using herbal medicine, not on COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of restless leg syndrome with herbal medicines and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the treatment of restless leg syndrome with herbal medicines and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
34392510,,Could Weight Loss During Clozapine Therapy be an Indicator of Poor Response?: A Case Report.,Kok Kendirlioglu B||Gursu Hariri A,"Even though effectiveness of clozapine on treatment resistant schizophrenia has been repeatedly demonstrated, it is also associated with many adverse effects including weight gain. Curiously, significant weight loss may occur in some patients. In this case report we discussed whether the observed weight loss could be a negative prognostic factor. The 56 year-old male patient, followed up with the diagnosis of schizophrenia for 20 years, had persistent positive and negative symptoms despite concurrent use of different antiypsychotics. He was diagnosed with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and started on clozapine with dose titration to 500 mg/day over 3 months. He was observed to have lost 17.6% of his initial body weight after 7 months of therapy. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score of the patient did not change significantly. There are a few case reports in the literature on weight loss during clozapine therapy. Some proposed that the weight loss could be a sign of weak response to treatment which is based on the observation that the clinical response might be poor when there is a weight loss and no change in blood triglyceride levels is observed with the treatment. There is a need for more case-control and preclinical studies to explain the mechanisms underlying weight loss and weak response to clozapine therapy in schizophrenia.",2021 Summer,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on weight loss associated with clozapine therapy in schizophrenia patients, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.

34362863,PMC8363658,Pleural Effusion Secondary to Dasatinib Following Allogenic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,Alrubaye RR||Fadel CA||Adewunmi CY||Del Rio Lopez L,"BACKGROUND Pleural effusions are frequently seen among patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the majority of cases, they are related to infections and volume overload. Medications have also been reported to cause pleural effusion in the general population, albeit very rarely. Dasatinib-induced pleural effusion has been reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia but not in those with HSCT. We here report a case of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion following HSCT for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The proposed mechanism of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion involves build-up of fluid due to an immune-mediated vascular insult. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man who received HSCT for ALL was treated with dasatinib to prevent a recurrence. After 6 months, the patient was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, which was observed as bilateral pleural effusion upon chest X-ray. After completing the antibiotics course, he developed recurrent pleural effusion during hospitalization. Repeated thoracentesis of the fluid revealed an exudative lymphocytic effusion with negative culture and cytology. Dasatinib was withdrawn and the pleural effusion resolved gradually. CONCLUSIONS In patients with dasatinib-induced pleural effusions following HCTS, withdrawal of the drug leads to symptom resolution, thereby avoiding unnecessary procedures. This case illustrates that dasatinib-induced pleural disease typically manifests with lymphocytic exudative fluid. Physicians should be aware that pleural effusion is a possible medication-related adverse effect, which may be missed in cases of infection in patients following HSCT.",2021 Aug 7,20210807.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of pleural effusion related to dasatinib following HSCT, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of pleural effusion related to dasatinib following HSCT, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,
34355374,,The first male case with fluoxetine induced hair loss and review of the literature.,Akyuz Karacan F||Tangilntiz A||Kirpinar I,"OBJECTIVE: Fluoxetine is the drug of choice in the treatment of depression. It is widely preferred due to fewer side effects and greater tolerability. Hair loss is a frequent adverse effect that may occur by psychotropic drug use and that can remit by its cessation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the diagnosis and treatment of a 26-year-old male patient. He was diagnosed with depression without psychotic features according to the DSM-V criteria and was administered fluoxetine in a dose of 20 mg/day. RESULTS: Six weeks after the initiation of the fluoxetine treatment, the patient reported hair loss in the frontal area of the skull. These complaints regressed after cessation of drug. CONCLUSIONS: Hair loss appears to be a rare side effect of fluoxetine-based treatment. Dermatologists and psychiatrists must be informed about this adverse side effect. There might be differences in the risk of hair loss between the various SSRIs and the risk might be higher in female than in male.

Here, we report a 62-year-old man with psoriasis and no prior history of sulfa allergy, who presented with a sudden onset of fever, chills, vomiting, and muscle aches 5 hours after taking single doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Common infectious causes were ruled out, and his medications were discontinued. Despite initial symptom resolution with discontinuation, the patient neurologically deteriorated over the next two days before eventually recovering with supportive care. This case highlights the variable presentation of drug-induced aseptic meningitis. In contrast to previous reports of drug-induced aseptic meningitis, our patient was male, older than the median age of 40 years, and did not have a prior adverse reaction to the antibiotic. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we report a possible case of antibiotic-induced aseptic meningitis in a patient with psoriasis. Lastly, the case emphasizes not only the value of a thorough medication history but also the importance of recognizing that patients may deteriorate in the first 48 hours before resolution.",2021 Jun,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses antibiotic-induced aseptic meningitis, which is unrelated to the complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses antibiotic-induced aseptic meningitis, which is unrelated to the complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
34149623,PMC8209372,Prolonged Hypophosphatemia and Intensive Care After Curative Surgery of Tumor Induced Osteomalacia: A Case Report.,Ryhanen EM||Schalin-Jantti C||Matikainen N,"INTRODUCTION: Rare FGF23-producing mesenchymal tumors lead to paraneoplastic tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) presenting with phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, chronic hypomineralization of the bone, fragility fractures and muscle weakness. Diagnosis of TIO requires exclusion of other etiologies and careful search for a mesenchymal tumor that often is very small and can appear anywhere in the body. Surgical removal of the tumor is the only definitive treatment of TIO. Surgical complications due to chronic hypophosphatemia are not well recognized. CASE DESCRIPTION: The current case describes severe fragility fractures in a 58-year-old woman, who lost her ability to walk and was bedridden for two years. First, the initial diagnostic laboratory work-up did not include serum phosphorus measurements, second, the suspicion of adverse effects of pioglitazone as an underlying cause delayed correct diagnosis for at least two years. After biochemical discovery of hyperphosphaturic hypophosphatemia at a tertiary referral centre, a FGF23-producing tumor of the mandible was discovered on physical examination, and then surgically removed. Postoperatively, severe hypophosphatemia and muscle weakness prolonged the need for ventilation support, intensive care and phosphate supplementation. After two years of rehabilitation, the patient was able to walk short distances. The tumor has not recurred, and serum phosphate concentration has remained within normal limits during 3.5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The case report illustrates knowledge gaps in the diagnostic work-up of rare causes of low bone mass and fragility fractures. Compared to other low phosphate conditions, surgical recovery from TIO-induced hypophosphatemia warrants special attention. Increased alkaline phosphatase concentration may indicate impaired postsurgical recovery due to prolonged hypophosphatemia, underlining the need for proactive perioperative correction of hypophosphatemia.",2021,20210603.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.

It is important that dentists and physicians be aware of patient history and examination findings commonly associated with FBS, as well as treatment options available for managing this condition. CASE DESCRIPTION: Described here is a case of FBS arising in a 43-year-old man after partial parotidectomy for the treatment of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma. His orofacial pain was being successfully treated by injection of onabotulinumtoxin A into the residual parotid tissue.

However, the response rate to ICIs is unsatisfactory, and unexpected hyperprogressive disease (HPD) is even observed in a small subgroup of patients. Patients with HPD usually have worsening clinical symptoms and poorer survival, and therapeutic strategies are extremely limited. Here, we presented a patient with HPD who had used a PD-L1 inhibitor and was highly responsive to the sequential use of a PD-1 inhibitor. A 67-year-old woman with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer was treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy after progression on previous multiple-line chemotherapy treatments. After 2 cycles of treatments, she rapidly developed HPD, as confirmed by radiological evaluation and worsening symptoms. At that time, pembrolizumab was discontinued, and she switched to the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus chemotherapy. This patient partially responded to atezolizumab plus chemotherapy without experiencing severe drug-related adverse effects. This is the first reported case of metastatic breast cancer in a patient with radiologically confirmed HPD after pembrolizumab therapy in which successful rechallenge with atezolizumab relieved clinical symptoms. Further studies with larger sample sizes involving a deeper translational investigation of HPD are needed to confirm the efficacy and mechanism of sequential application of different ICIs for the clinical management of HPD.",2021,20210531.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the response to immunotherapy in metastatic breast cancer and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the response to immunotherapy in metastatic breast cancer and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could reestablish the micro-ecological balance in IgAN, although this has never been attempted before. We explored whether FMT could be efficacious in treating IgAN in two patients with refractory IgAN. CASE PRESENTATION: Two Chinese female patients with IgAN failed to achieve clinical remission after receiving several rounds of immunosuppressive therapy and suffered from unbearable adverse effects due to immunosuppressants. Both patients received intensive fresh FMT conducted through transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) regularly for 6-7 months, and were followed up for a further 6 months. Partial clinical remission was achieved in both patients, evidenced by a decrease in the 24-h urinary protein (24-hUP) to less than half of baseline during FMT treatment or follow-up, along with increased serum albumin (sAlb) and stable kidney function. The gut microbiota of both patients was distorted with lower biodiversity and altered composition, which was reversed following FMT. Phylum Proteobacteria decreased while genus Prevotella increased during and after FMT. The intensive fresh FMT was well-tolerated, and no severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of FMT for treating refractory IgAN may provide a new direction by which to decipher the pathogenesis of IgAN.",2021 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation on IgA nephropathy and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation on IgA nephropathy and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
34100906,,Transition from IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil in a patient with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension.,Sarangarm P||Elwood K,"PURPOSE: Epoprostenol and treprostinil are prostacyclins indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Although there is literature describing the conversion of intravenous (IV) epoprostenol to IV treprostinil or IV treprostinil to oral treprostinil, there is little data on the direct conversion of IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil. In this case, we describe the direct conversion of IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil without an intermediary conversion to IV treprostinil. SUMMARY: A 39 year-old female with PAH was admitted for altered mental status and self-removal of her peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) used for IV epoprostenol. Given the unplanned hospitalization, absence of a dedicated central line for IV prostacyclin therapy, and concern the patient may remove a future subcutaneous line, the patient was transitioned to oral treprostinil. Of note, despite triple PAH therapy, the patient was unable to reach a low risk group based on her prognostic risk assessment. A right heart catheterization four months prior found severe PAH with a pulmonary arterial pressure of 79/32 mmHg (mean, 49 mmHg) and pulmonary vascular resistance of 10.6 Wood units. To expedite the transition, the patient was directly converted from IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil without an intermediary conversion to IV treprostinil. A target oral treprostinil dose of 5 mg TID was calculated based on 110% of the IV epoprostenol dose (19 ng/kg/min) utilizing the conversion recommended by the medication manufacturer. Every 8 hours, IV epoprostenol was decreased by 2 ng/kg/min and oral treprostinil was increased by 0.5 mg. The target oral treprostinil dose of 5 mg TID was reached 72 hours after conversion initiation. Three hours after the final titration, the patient was discharged home on room air. CONCLUSION: In this case, rapid transition from IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil was achieved in 72 hours without reported adverse effects.",2021 Nov 23,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the transition between two PAH medications and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the transition between two PAH medications and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the transition from IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil in a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}",The article discusses the transition from IV epoprostenol to oral treprostinil in a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,95,,

Previous encouraging clinical and experimental results support the use of endoluminal thermal ablation (ETHA) of the main pancreatic duct to reduce pancreatic exocrine secretion and hence POPF. We here describe our initial clinical experience with ETHA of the main pancreatic duct in two cases at high risk of POPF. METHODS: Two cases underwent PD for malignancy with a high risk of POPF (adenocarcinoma, obese patients, surgical difficulties with heavy intraoperative blood loss, soft pancreas or walled-off pancreatitis and a tight small pancreatic main duct). In both cases, ETHA of the main pancreatic duct was conducted intraoperatively just before Blumgart-type pancreatic-jejunal anastomosis using a ClosureFast catheter (Medtronic, Mansfield, MA, USA) normally used for varicose vein treatment (therefore an off-label use). RESULTS: Although a clear radiological POPF was detected in the second case, the clinical postoperative course in both cases was uneventful. Little pancreatic fluid collected in the abdominal drainage with low levels of amylase enzyme, confirming low exocrine pancreatic function. No other procedure-related complications were detected.

The perioperative adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, especially euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA), should be taken into consideration in perioperative patient evaluation in both elective and emergency surgeries. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old woman taking SGLT2 inhibitors for T2D developed euDKA after undergoing an emergency orthopedic surgery; the euDKA diagnosis was delayed, thereby causing extremity gangrene. DIAGNOSES: EuDKA was diagnosed based on the presence of strongly positive ketonuria, elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate level, and severe metabolic acidosis. INTERVENTION: EuDKA was treated with insulin infusion with dextrose solution and intravenous fluid resuscitation. OUTCOME: Due to a delayed diagnosis of euDKA, the patient received a high-dose vasopressor, which led to limb gangrene and amputation 6 months later. LESSONS: EuDKA is often misdiagnosed due to the absence of hyperglycemia.

Hormon receptor positive (HR+) subtype constitutes 75% of the diagnosed breast cancers. Combination of the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor and endocrine therapy significantly improves overall survival and progression-free survival. Ribociclib is an oral CDK 4/6 inhibitor and some adverse effects are identified. According to MONALEESA 2-3-7 studies, no adverse effect (AE) were reported due to grade 3 or 4 acute kidney injury (AKI) that caused treatment discontinuation. CASE REPORT: We report a ribociclib-induced grade 3 AKI in an elderly woman who was treated for metastatic breast cancer. During first cycle of therapy, she was admitted to the oncology clinic with diagnosis of AKI.Management and outcome: Ribociclib treatment was discontinued and secondary causes of AKI were excluded. During the follow-up, kidney function values returned to the normal range spontaneously. Ribociclib treatment was re-initiated by reducing the dose (400 mg daily). Despite dose reduction; grade 3 AKI recurred when ribociclib was re-initiated and the drug was permanently discontinued. DISCUSSION: According to MONALEESA 2-3-7 studies; no AE were reported due to grade 3 or 4 AKI. Despite these studies, the FDA reported that 20% of patients with ribociclib + letrozole combination therapy may have any stage elevation of creatinine. Ribociclib induced creatinine elevations are generally mild (grade 1-2) and can be managed by dose reduction or close monitoring of creatinine levels.

However, little is known about their nephrotoxicity. To date, only two cases of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis after exposure to checkpoint inhibitors have been documented. Herein, we report the first case of a patient with metastatic melanoma who developed linear Immunoglobulin G 3+, Immunoglobulin A 2+, kappa 2+, lambda 1+ anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis with negative serology following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors and subsequently mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Caucasian male was referred to our outpatient nephrology clinic with acute kidney injury and proteinuria. He had received three cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab for recurrent melanoma positive for the BRAF V600E mutation with metastasis to the lungs. Immunotherapy had been discontinued in the setting of severe adverse effects including dermatitis, colitis, and hepatitis. Because of persistent bilateral lung metastases and left pleural metastases, the patient had been initiated on dabrafenib and trametinib until his presentation to our clinic 6 months later. On presentation, his blood pressure was 172/89 mm/Hg and had 2+ edema bilaterally. His creatinine level was 2.4 mg/dL from a previous normal baseline with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 2 g/g. His urinalysis showed dysmorphic erythrocytes and red blood cell casts. Serologic testing was negative for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, proteinase 3 antigen, myeloperoxidase, and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody. Complement levels were normal. A renal biopsy showed focal crescentic (2 of 15 glomeruli with cellular crescents), proliferative, and sclerosing glomerulonephritis with diffuse linear staining of glomerular capillary loops dominant for IgG (3+), IgA (2+), kappa (2+), and lambda (1+) minimal changes. He was initiated on oral cyclophosphamide and pulse intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone for 6 months, which stabilized his renal function until reinitiation of immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury is an increasingly reported adverse effect of both drug classes, mostly affecting the tubulointerstitial compartment and infrequently the glomerulus. Although the biologic effect of these drugs on immune cells is not entirely understood, it is possible that BRAF-induced podocyte injury in combination with direct T-cell-mediated glomerular injury facilitated by checkpoint inhibitors led to the unmasking of cryptic antigens, loss of self-tolerance, and autoimmunity. More importantly, we show that treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide was able to improve and stabilize our patient's renal function until the reinitiation of immunotherapy.",2021 Apr 3,20210403.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses nephrotoxicity related to immune checkpoint inhibitors and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors in melanoma treatment, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses nephrotoxicity related to immune checkpoint inhibitors and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors in melanoma treatment, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is generally well tolerated. However, it can cause some serious adverse effects. The most common of these are edema on the face and legs, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and rash on the skin. The most serious side effects, albeit less common, are gastrointestinal or intraabdominal bleeding. However, thrombotic events such as sigmoid sinus thrombosis and splenic infarction are extremely rare. The current report presents a patient with GIST who is treated with imatinib 400 mg/day. The patient presented with edema on the face and headache in the second month of imatinib therapy, after which she was diagnosed with sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The patient who presented with abdominal pain approximately three months later developed splenic infarction. She was administered acetylsalicylic acid, supplemental oxygen (O2) in the first episode of thrombosis, and imatinib therapy was discontinued. The patient's complaints and thrombus regressed, after which imatinib therapy was resumed. She was administered intravenous hydration, supplemental oxygen, analgesics, and imatinib therapy was discontinued after the patient sustained splenic infarction. After resolution of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and the regression of splenic infarction area, the patient was switched to sunitinib therapy. She is attending routine control visits.

Several reports have suggested that dose adjustments of cetuximab, an anti- epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, are not required in patients with renal impairment. However, the combination chemotherapy of ramucirumab and cytotoxic drug for hemodialysis (HD) patients has not been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old man on HD was diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was examined after completion of 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine combination oxaliplatin. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer at stage IIIb (pT3N2M0) 11 months ago. Unfortunately, 9 months after the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, multiple liver metastases from gastric cancer were found by abdominal CT. INTERVENTIONS: He began receiving weekly paclitaxel(80 mg/m2) and every 15-day ramucirumab (8 mg/kg). HD was performed next day after administration of chemotherapy and repeated 3 times a week. OUTCOMES: He was treated with ramucirumab without dose adjustment. The metastatic liver mass had a partial response, after 2 and 4 cycles of chemotherapy and had a stable disease up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. No obvious adverse effect was observed during treatment. However, after 14 cycles chemotherapy, follow-up abdominal CT revealed progression disease of multiple liver metastasis and lymph nodes invasion.

The patient suffered choledocholithiasis and had a mural chronic CA-PVT extending from the superior mesenteric vein to the portal trunk. He underwent open cholecystectomy and choledochotomy. Early postoperative clinical course was uneventful except for abdominal distension due to ascites diagnosed on postoperative day (POD)7 when hospital discharge was planned. Contrast enhancement computed tomography (CE-CT) taken on POD 7 revealed the exacerbation of the CA-PVT. Despite recommendation for extension of hospital admission with low molecular weight heparin treatment, the patient strongly hoped to be discharged. Unwillingly, we selected DOAC, edoxaban, as an initial treatment, which was commenced the day after discharge (POD8). As a result, the remarkable improvement of the exacerbated CA-PVT was confirmed by the CE-CT taken on POD21. Any bleeding complications were not observed. Although a slight residue of the CA-PVT remains, the patient is currently doing well 4 years after surgery and is still receiving edoxaban. Any adverse effects of edoxaban have not been observed for 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: A case of successful treatment of the acute exacerbation of CA-PVT with edoxaban was reported. Moreover, edoxaban has been safely administered in a cirrhotic patient for 4 years. The findings obtained from the present case suggest that DOAC can be used as an initial treatment for CA-PVT even in early postoperative period after major abdominal surgery.",2021 Feb 10,20210210.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the treatment of portal vein thrombosis with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the treatment of portal vein thrombosis with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of portal vein thrombosis in a cirrhotic patient and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the treatment of portal vein thrombosis in a cirrhotic patient and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

33507945,PMC7842918,Comparison of different cardiovascular risk tools used in HIV patient cohorts in sub-Saharan Africa; do we need to include laboratory tests?,Mubiru F||Castelnuovo B||Reynolds SJ||Kiragga A||Tibakabikoba H||Owarwo NC||Kambugu A||Lamorde M||Parkes-Ratanshi R,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, representing 31% of all global deaths. HIV and long term anti-retroviral therapy (ART) are risk factors for development of CVD in populations of people living with HIV (PLHIV). CVD risk assessment tools are currently being applied to SSA populations, but there are questions about accuracy as well as implementation challenges of these tools in lower resource setting populations. We aimed to assess the level of agreement between the various cardiovascular screening tools (Data collection on Adverse effects of anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D), Framingham risk score, WHO risk score and The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Score) when applied to an HIV ART experienced population in Sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: This study was undertaken in an Anti-Retroviral Long Term (ALT) Cohort of 1000 PLHIV in care who have been on ART for at least 10 years in urban Uganda. A systematic review was undertaken to find the most frequently used screening tools from SSA PLHIV populations; these were applied to the ALT cohort. Levels of agreement between the resulting scores (those including lipids and non-lipids based, as well as HIV-specific and non-HIV specific) as applied to our cohort were compared. Prevalence Bias Adjusted Kappa was used to evaluate agreement between tools. RESULTS: Overall, PLHIV in ALT cohort had a median score of 1.1-1.4% risk of a CVD event over 5 years and 1.7-2.5% risk of a CVD event over 10 years. There was no statistical difference in the risk scores obtained for this population when comparing the different tools, including comparisons of those with lipids and non-lipids, and HIV specific vs non-HIV specific. CONCLUSION: The various tools yielded similar results, but those not including lipids are more feasible to apply in our setting. Long-term cohorts of PLHIV in SSA should in future provide longitudinal data to evaluate existing CVD risk prediction tools for these populations. Inclusion of HIV and ART history factors to existing scoring systems may improve accuracy without adding the expense and technical difficulty of lipid testing.",2021,20210128.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on cardiovascular disease in HIV patients and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on cardiovascular disease in HIV patients and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article focuses on cardiovascular risk assessment tools in HIV patients and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article focuses on cardiovascular risk assessment tools in HIV patients and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
33493142,PMC7841692,A 78-Year-Old Man with a Pulmonary Embolism Who Developed Skin Necrosis 7 Days After Treatment with the Direct Oral Anticoagulant Factor Xa Inhibitor Apixaban.,Pansuriya T||Nguyen T||Sadat MA||Raza SA||Sarva ST,"BACKGROUND Apixaban is one of the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) being used to manage venous thrombosis. Skin toxicities are recognized adverse effects of the new DOACs, but are rare and usually associated with vasculitis. This report is of a 78-year-old man admitted to the hospital with pulmonary thromboembolism, who developed severe and extensive skin necrosis of both forearms 7 days after treatment with apixaban. CASE REPORT A 78-year-old man was admitted for pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation. He was started on therapeutic enoxaparin and diuresis. Later on, enoxaparin was substituted with apixaban. Seven days after starting apixaban, he suddenly developed skin changes that developed into skin necrosis on both forearms and the abdominal wall. A skin biopsy was not performed due to the high risk of bleeding. Skin necrosis was diagnosed based on clinical findings. A review of clinical data and the patient's medication profile did not reveal any other possible etiology or culprit medication. Clinical presentation and lab values were not consistent with infections or autoimmune etiologies. Apixaban was discontinued as it was perceived to be the likely cause of skin necrosis. The skin changes gradually improved within 1 week with supportive wound care, and the patient did not require a skin graft. The patient was discharged safely with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. CONCLUSIONS This report shows that skin toxicity can be associated with apixaban and that with the increasing use of these newer DOACs, clinicians should be aware of these potential adverse effects.",2021 Jan 25,20210125.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, but rather focuses on skin necrosis associated with apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, but rather focuses on skin necrosis associated with apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses skin necrosis as a complication associated with the anticoagulant apixaban, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses skin necrosis as a complication associated with the anticoagulant apixaban, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Further chart review reveals both patients receiving a central venous procedure in the past, thus attributing the hydrophilic polymers as the likely source of the foreign material found at the insertion site. Our cases contrast to the more commonly reported distal embolization by these hydrophilic polymer layers.

33361737,PMC7768591,Musical Hallucinations Induced by Conventional Doses of Paroxetine.,Muraosa H||Suzuki A||Noto K||Otani K,"BACKGROUND A musical hallucination (MH) is a type of auditory hallucination, and is defined as hearing music, sounds, or songs in the absence of external auditory stimuli. There are several case reports of conventional doses of tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants inducing MHs, but no such report for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Here we report a case of a patient with MHs induced by conventional doses of paroxetine. CASE REPORT The patient was a 22-year-old woman with panic disorder (PD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). On the 10th day of treatment with paroxetine 20 mg/d, olanzapine 5 mg/d, and lorazepam 1.5 mg/d, she developed MHs such as ""an opera song sung by a female singer."" The MHs occurred several times a day, and once continued for 5 to 10 min. Because of a suspicion of paroxetine-induced MHs and poor clinical improvement, paroxetine was reduced and discontinued on the 31st day, whereas venlafaxine was started and increased to 75 mg/d. Two days after the discontinuation of paroxetine, the MHs disappeared and symptoms of PD and MDD were much improved. Several weeks later, in response to a negative life event, her symptoms of PD and MDD returned to the original levels, but MHs were not observed. CONCLUSIONS The present report suggests that conventional doses of paroxetine can induce MHs, which are most likely ascribable to the anticholinergic effects of the drug.

The most common causes of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy are gestational transient thyrotoxicosis and Graves' disease. It is important to distinguish between these entities as treatment options differ. Women of reproductive age who are diagnosed with Graves' disease should be counseled regarding the impact of treatment options on a potential pregnancy. Although the absolute risk is small, antithyroid medications can have teratogenic effects. Propylthiouracil appears to have less severe teratogenicity compared to methimazole and is therefore favored during the first trimester if a medication is needed. Women should be advised to delay pregnancy for at least 6 months following radioactive iodine to minimize potential adverse effects from radiation and ensure normal thyroid hormone levels prior to conception. As thyroid hormone is critical for normal fetal development, hypothyroidism is associated with adverse obstetric and child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Women with overt hypothyroidism should be treated with levothyroxine (LT4) to a thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone; TSH) goal of <2.5 mIU/L. There is mounting evidence for associations of maternal hypothyroxinemia and subclinical hypothyroidism with pregnancy loss, preterm labor, and lower scores on child cognitive assessment.

This is, however, an infrequent adverse effect. Selective Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, in contrast, is the most common primary immunodeficiency. Patients with IgA deficiency are at risk of developing infectious diseases, but also autoimmune diseases such as Grave's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. CASE REPORT We report a case of methimazole-induced lupus erythematosus in a 32-year-old man with renal involvement and concomitant selective IgA deficiency. Symptoms promptly resolved after treatment with hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids after discontinuation of methimazole. Lupus nephritis required treatment with cyclophosphamide followed by maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil. CONCLUSIONS Drug-induced lupus erythematosus usually develops after a few months or years of exposure to the causative agent. No specific symptoms exist. The diagnosis is not based on particular specific tests, but relies on a set of arguments evoking the role of the medication inducing the condition. The first step in treatment is to stop the causative drug. The therapeutic management of the various manifestations does not differ from that of idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus. We briefly discuss the relationship between drug-induced lupus erythematosus, Grave's disease, and IgA deficiency, and suggest that IgA deficiency may act as a potential risk factor.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) represents a rare but severe adverse effect (AE) that could occur even after many years from the beginning of IFNbeta therapy. Eculizumab is currently approved for treatment of aHUS and recently for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) with aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG). In this article, we report the case of the latest onset of IFNbeta-related aHUS experienced by an MS patient and we briefly review the literature on this topic. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, and we performed a retrospective analysis of RRMS patients that received IFNbeta-1a in our center and developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). From this search, we identified only one patient. RESULTS: In the published literature, we identified 24 MS patients who received IFNbeta as disease-modifying treatment (DMT) and then developed thrombotic microangiopathy with kidney injury. The aHUS has been diagnosed in 6, all received IFNbeta-1a and the latest onset was after 15 years. We report a case of a 39-year-old man affected by RRMS who assumed IFNbeta-1a since 1999. In July 2018, he developed an IFNbeta-related aHUS. After the failure of plasma exchange, he underwent eculizumab, with an improvement of glomerular filtration rate and without new signs of MS activity. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this case represents the latest onset of IFNbeta-related aHUS in MS patients.

On the other hand, periprostatic abscesses formation and rectal perforation are known as rare adverse effects of SpaceOAR. Nevertheless, there is a lack of reports clarifying the association between aggravation of abscesses and radiation therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is effective for a peri-SpaceOAR abscess and rectal perforation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 78-year-old high-risk prostate cancer patient. After SpaceOAR insertion into the correct space, he started to receive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). He developed a fever, perineal pain and frequent urination after the completion of EBRT, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a peri-SpaceOAR abscess.

In these tissues, SLC13A5 has important functions in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and neurotransmitters. In recent years, patients homozygous for recessive mutations in SLC13A5, known as SLC13A5 deficiency [early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-25 (EIEE-25)], exhibit severe global developmental delay, early-onset intractable seizures, spasticity, and amelogenesis imperfecta affecting tooth development. Although the pathogenesis of SLC13A5 deficiency remains not clearly understood, cytoplasmic citrate deficits, decreased energy status in neurons, and citrate-zinc chelation are hypothesized to explain the neurological deficits. However, no study has examined the possibility of specific pharmacological drugs and/or lifestyle changes synergizing with heterozygosity of SLC13A5 deficiency to increase the risk of EIEE-25 clinical phenotype. Here, we report on a heterozygous SLC13A5-deficient patient who demonstrated evidence of pharmaco-synergistic heterozygosity upon administration of metformin, valproic acid, and starvation.

33249739,,An unusual adverse event of botulinum toxin injection in the lower face.,Auada Souto MP||Souto LRM,"BACKGROUND: In the lower third of the face, botulinum toxin A is used to obtain a more harmonious contour. The anatomical complexity of the face requires a more precise application of botulinum toxin. AIM: Describe the treatment of an unexpected effect after botulinum toxin A application in the lower third of the face. PATIENT/METHODS: A 51-year-old female patient presented to our clinic for application of botulin toxin aiming to improve facial wrinkles and contour. 50 U of botulinum toxin type A were applied to the upper third and 20 U to the lower third of the face. The patient returned after 10 days with a smile asymmetry and an excessive and unconscious lowering on the right side of the lower lip while laughing. So, 3 U of botulinum toxin were applied to the center of the depressor labii inferioris muscle on the right side. RESULTS: The patient returned with a satisfactory correction of the smile asymmetry. CONCLUSION: Although treatments with botulinum toxin A are considered safe, unexpected results can occur. In our case, it probably occurred due to medial injection or diffusion of botulinum toxin A into depressor anguli oris muscle on the left side that may lead to paralysis of the left depressor labii inferioris muscle and downward hyperfunction of the unaffected right lower lip.

This study evaluated the clinical practice and outcome of DBS for TS in a Japanese institution. This study included 25 consecutive patients with refractory TS treated with thalamic centromedian-parafascicular nucleus DBS. The severity of tics was evaluated with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) before surgery, at 1 year after surgery, and at the last follow-up of 3 years or more after surgery. The occurrence of adverse events, active contact locations, and stimulation conditions were also evaluated. YGTSS tic severity score decreased by average 45.2% at 1 year, and by 56.6% at the last follow-up. The reduction was significant for all aspects of the scores including motor tics, phonic tics, and impairment. The mean coordinates of active contacts were 7.62 mm lateral to the midline, 3.28 mm posterior to the midcommissural point, and 3.41 mm above anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. Efficacy and stimulation conditions were equivalent to international reports. The stimulation-induced side effects included dysarthria (32.0%) and paresthesia (12.0%).

33170832,PMC7666438,Lumbar Compression Fracture Caused by Cardioversion.,Koda EK,"BACKGROUND Cardioversion is a safe, commonly used procedure throughout the world. It is performed over 30 000 times per year in the United States, specifically for atrial fibrillation. Procedural risks from cardioversion include clot dislodgement, sedation effects, site pain, burns, hypotension, dysrhythmias, or heart failure. Generally, back pain is considered to be simple muscle soreness, and cardioversion consents therefore do not include discussion of back injuries. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old man with no prior back pain or injury history underwent a planned synchronized cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. He immediately reported new back pain following the procedure. No unusual event such as a fall occurred near the time of the procedure, but upon evaluation, he was found to have a new lumbar compression fracture that caused incapacitating pain for more than 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Cardioversion has been found to be a safe, effective treatment for atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects are generally minor, and the frequency of adverse effects appear to be low overall. The case reported here represents a rare, but possibly underreported adverse effect, namely, lumbar compression fracture due to cardioversion. Patients should be counseled on the possibility of back injury, even compression fracture, as a result of cardioversion. It would also be prudent to broaden the differential diagnosis possibilities should a patient complain of back pain after cardioversion.",2020 Nov 10,20201110.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to cardioversion, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to cardioversion, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,90,,

METHODS: This study enrolled 3 patients who developed necrotizing scleritis immediately after undergoing pterygium excision. All cases with pterygium were primary, and topical mitomycin C and conjunctival autografts were used at the time of surgery. Noninvasive therapy that included ophthalmic lubricants and topical and systemic corticosteroids failed to improve the avascular scleral lesions. The patients were prescribed erythropoietin-containing drops (3000 U/mL) every 6 hours in addition to topical antibiotics and lubricant. The effect of topical erythropoietin on the healing process of avascular scleral lesions was investigated, and its ocular and systemic side effects were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 69.0 +/- 14.8 years, and 2 of the 3 eyes belonged to male subjects. The time between pterygium surgery and presentation to our clinic was 33.0 +/- 14.7 days. There were no infectious causes or underlying systemic diseases in any of the cases. After treatment with topical erythropoietin for an average of 34.3 +/- 20.3 days, the lesions were completely vascularized in all 3 eyes without any ocular or systemic adverse effects. The patients were followed up for an average of 126 +/- 94 days after discontinuation of erythropoietin. There was no evidence of recurrence during the last examination in any of the eyes.

MALA is a high anion gap (AG), nonosmolar acidosis. Associated osmolar-gap (OG) is rarely reported, so finding an OG may make the diagnosis of MALA challenging. PATIENT CONCERNS: Forty-five years' old type II diabetic patient on metformin presented to emergency with a two-day history of vomiting, watery diarrhea, and mild abdominal discomfort. On examinations, he looked dehydrated. Investigation revealed acute kidney injury (AKI) with a high lactic acid (LA) level of 24 mmol/L, pH of 6.8, AG of 40, and an OG of 20 mOsm/kg DIAGNOSES:: The presence of an OG made the diagnosis challenging; the history was negative for alcohol, osmolar substance, or illicit drug ingestion or use. The toxicology screen was negative. After ruling out plausible causes of AG and OG, MALA was deemed the likely reason for his presentation likely precipitated by dehydration and AKI. INTERVENTIONS: He underwent two sessions of hemodialysis, afterward managed with fluid hydration. OUTCOMES: On day 3, he was in the polyuric phase suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. His serum creatinine improved afterward with improved acidosis; after 8 days, he was discharged in stable condition. LESSONS: MALA is a rare side effect of metformin therapy.

32975694,,Melanoma-associated retinopathy during pembrolizumab treatment probably controlled by intravitreal injections of dexamethasone.,Poujade L||Samaran Q||Mura F||Guillot B||Meunier I||Du-Thanh A,"PURPOSE: Melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome due to antibodies targeting bipolar retinal cells. Its evolution, particularly in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), is currently poorly understood. In the few cases published, patients' visual function got worse when these molecules were prescribed. Here, we present a case of a patient with severe MAR treated with an ICI for melanoma progression. METHODS: A 68-year-old woman with a history of melanoma of the palpebral conjunctiva presented with sudden and gradually worsening visual disturbances. Simultaneously, a metastatic evolution of the melanoma was diagnosed and surgically treated exclusively. Visual acuity assessment, static automated perimetry and ERG results lead to the diagnosis of MAR. Since systemic corticosteroid therapy did not improve her symptoms, repeated intraocular corticosteroid injections were performed with a positive outcome. Later on, metastatic progression of the patient's melanoma led to the introduction of pembrolizumab, an ICI targeting PD-1. Immunotherapy has changed the prognosis of patient affected by metastatic melanoma, but these molecules may induce various immune-related adverse effects. In our case, intraocular corticosteroid injections were still performed simultaneously. Visual acuity assessment, static automated perimetry and ERG were performed during the course of this treatment. RESULTS: Full-field ERGs results suggested the possibility that the ophthalmologic treatment might restore the patient's retinal function despite the continued immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of MAR with a positive outcome after 1 year of ICI, possibly thanks to intravitreal corticosteroid therapy.",2021 Apr,20200925.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses melanoma-associated retinopathy and its treatment during pembrolizumab therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses melanoma-associated retinopathy and its treatment during pembrolizumab therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.",2,95,,
32946431,PMC7521460,Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) Induced by Long-Term Use of Citalopram and Short-Term Use of Naproxen.,Chiu CY||Sarwal A||Azhar Munir R||Widjaja M||Khalid A||Khanna R,"BACKGROUND Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been reported to be associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), although it is uncommon. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as a sole agent, are an even rarer cause of SIADH. Despite being documented in the literature, the understanding of the mechanism of both agents is limited. Here, we report a case of a patient taking both of these medications, a dangerous combination that led to the development of SIADH. CASE REPORT An 88-year-old woman with a history of asymptomatic chronic hyponatremia presented to our facility with symptomatic acute-on-chronic hyponatremia after she started using naproxen in addition to her daily citalopram. Her hyponatremia symptoms resolved after discontinuing these 2 offending agents, along with administration of fluid restriction and oral sodium supplements. CONCLUSIONS Naproxen is commonly prescribed and is often taken by elderly patients to control long-term or short-term pain. SSRIs, on the other hand, are a first-line treatment for depression and are usually prescribe by a psychiatrist. Hyponatremia is a rare medication adverse effect that should be kept in mind when treating these patients with either of these medications, and should especially be considered when combining them. Medication reconciliation should be done carefully by the provider to avoid adverse effects and drug interactions. When hyponatremia is encountered, options for future medication prescriptions include rechallenging with the same medication, switching to a different medication with the same mechanism of action, or using a medication from another class altogether. Monitoring of serum sodium level is warranted when titrating the offending agent.",2020 Sep 18,20200918.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of medications (citalopram and naproxen) leading to SIADH, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the required focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of medications (citalopram and naproxen) leading to SIADH, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the required focus for scoring.",2,90,,

However, long-term adverse effects are very rare. The treatment for accidental finger-stick injuries is controversial and includes intra-arterial injections of vasodilating agents, topical vasodilators, and supportive management as needed. CASE REPORT Here, we report a case of a 26-year-old pharmacist who injected herself accidentally with an EpiPen on the tip of her index finger. Warm water and nitroglycerine gel did not alleviate her symptoms. After three hours, phentolamine was injected around the necrotic area, and the skin normalized.

He developed hyponatremia (serum sodium 105 mEq/L) on day 3 of therapy. The potential causes of hyponatremia were evaluated. After ruling out other causes, the cause was suspected to be Cotrimoxazole-induced syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). We subsequently re-initiated therapy with Cotrimoxazole and the hyponatremia (serum sodium 110 mEq/L) recurred. Upon discontinuation of therapy, serum sodium levels returned to normal. The patient was started on Amoxycillin-Clavulanic Acid as an alternative therapy for pulmonary nocardiosis which resulted in resolution of the hyponatremia. Cotrimoxazole-induced SIADH is a rare occurrence. This case is representative of a patient with Cotrimoxazole-induced SIADH and the causal relationship was confirmed once resumption of therapy with the offending medi-cation resulted in hyponatremia.

They commonly present with nonspecific symptoms and thus are often discovered incidentally. They are best identified by CT scan, and most stain positive for CD117 (C-Kit), CD34, and/or DOG-1. Several risk stratification classification systems have been developed based on tumor size, mitotic rate, location, and perforation. Traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been very ineffective, making surgery the mainstay of treatment. The discovery of mutations associated with these tumors has revolutionized the treatment approach. Imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, used as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, has greatly improved the morbidity and mortality associated with GISTs. As the survival of patients has increased with the long-term use of targeted therapies, quality-of-life issues now have become much more relevant and have come to the forefront of care.

32671986,PMC7941413,Polymyalgia rheumatica in a melanoma patient 11 months after completion of immunotherapy with nivolumab.,Lobo Y||Good P||Murphy F,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionised the treatment of several cancers but can also lead to the development of immune-related adverse effects including dermatologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary and less commonly, rheumatic toxicities. Toxicities associated with ICI therapy can occur several months or even years after initiation. Case reports of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) associated with nivolumab use are rare. We herein describe, for the first time, a case of PMR in a melanoma patient after cessation of treatment with nivolumab. CASE: An 88-year-old man with a history of stage IV M1c BRAF wild-type melanoma presented with a 1 month history of arthralgias and morning stiffness, predominantly affecting the shoulders and hips, associated with fatigue and weight loss. He had undergone wide local excision of a primary malignant melanoma in the left buttock region several years prior. Immunotherapy with nivolumab was initiated following disease relapse with multiple metastases. Nivolumab was discontinued due to demonstration of complete metabolic response on serial positron emission and computed tomography scans. Symptoms appeared 11 months after completion of treatment. A diagnosis of PMR was made and treatment with oral prednisone was initiated leading to complete resolution of symptoms within 1 week. We believe that the development of PMR in our patient was likely precipitated by nivolumab. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that PMR, although rare, may occur as an adverse effect both during and after treatment with nivolumab, leading to disabling symptoms and poor quality of life. Prompt diagnosis is crucial to enable timely commencement of corticosteroid therapy in order to avoid further impact on morbidity and mortality for cancer patients. This case highlights the importance of prompt referral to rheumatology, as well as the need for close collaboration between oncologists and rheumatologists to accurately diagnose and successfully manage these patients.",2020 Jun,20200406.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses polymyalgia rheumatica as an adverse effect of nivolumab immunotherapy in a melanoma patient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses polymyalgia rheumatica as an adverse effect of nivolumab immunotherapy in a melanoma patient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

While effective, they are often discontinued due to toxicities and hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) that occur more frequently with repeated exposure. Following discontinuation of one agent, therapy may be continued with a second platinum salt, though the cross-reactivity between agents in this class is not well understood. This is particularly true for alternative routes of administration such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). In this case report, we describe the use of cisplatin during HIPEC in a patient who previously experienced an HSR to systemic oxaliplatin. The patient tolerated HIPEC including 200 mg cisplatin for 1 hour without any adverse effects and did not require a desensitization protocol prior to therapy.

Although the precise mechanism of BCG immunotherapy is still unclear, a local immune response is presumed. However, a number of severe side effects and complications are related to intravesical immunotherapy. AIM: Aim of this report is to present rare case of the renal granulomatous disease in a patient previously treated with intravesical instillation of BCG immunotherapy, following TURBT. In addition, we performed review of previously reported cases of renal granulomas following intravesical BCG immunotherapy. CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old man was presented to Urology Clinic due to clinically verified tumor of the urinary bladder. After transurethral resection of bladder tumor, histopathological analysis revealed the diagnosis of papillary urothelial high-grade pT1 carcinoma. Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was initiated, according to protocol currently used in our institution. Upon completion of therapy with BCG, we re-examined the patient and, using ultrasound, found a change in the right kidney, resembling moth bites not seen on CT scan before TURBT. Additionally, CT-guided core-needle biopsy of the affected kidney was performed, and the specimen was sent for histopathological analysis, which revealed chronic necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Antituberculotic therapy was initiated for 6 months. Upon completion of antituberculotic therapy, control CT-scan was performed at follow-up, indicating regression of changes on the right kidney. CONCLUSION: This case report emphasizes the importance of consistent implementation of follow-up protocol and the identification of lesions during the asymptomatic period and enables the proper treatment of the disease. To reduce the incidence of adverse effects of BCG treatment for bladder tumors, an individualized approach is needed.",2020 Apr,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on complications of BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on complications of BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

As with other sedatives, adverse effects with methohexital include excess sedation and hypotension, but this agent can also lower the seizure threshold. We report a patient who developed a generalized seizure after administration of methohexital. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old man presented to the ED by ambulance with chest pain and shortness of breath. Paramedics had administered adenosine for supraventricular tachycardia without conversion before arrival to the ED. He had no history of seizures. His initial vital signs in the ED included heart rate of 189 beats/min with a supraventricular rhythm, blood pressure 137/108 mm Hg, respiration 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. It was decided to attempt synchronized electrical cardioversion, and methohexital 1 mg/kg (120 mg) was administered over 2 min for moderate sedation. Within 15 s of methohexital administration, the patient developed a generalized seizure that lasted for 90 s. After seizure termination, he was successfully cardioverted, returned to his previous baseline level of consciousness within 20 min, and discharged without further problems with a follow-up referral to neurology. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Methohexital is a short-acting barbiturate used for moderate sedation.

32556969,,Use of Butorphanol as Treatment for Cholestatic Itch.,Golpanian RS||Yosipovitch G||Levy C,"BACKGROUND: Pruritus is a debilitating symptom of cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and often results in major reduction in quality of life for afflicted patients. Classic treatment options for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus include antihistamines, bile acid resins, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and mu-opioid antagonists. Unfortunately, these drugs are not always successful in treating pruritus of cholestasis and may be associated with adverse effects. Recent advances in our understanding of itch pathophysiology have led to the use of butorphanol, a kappa-opioid agonist and mu-opioid antagonist, for the treatment of various forms of pruritus. Reports of butorphanol to treat cholestatic itch specifically are rare. AIMS: To better understand the role of butorphanol in the treatment of cholestatic pruritus, including characterization of its side effect profile. METHODS: We present a case series of eight adult patients with cholestatic disease who were treated with butorphanol in hopes of alleviating intractable pruritus. Patients were identified through a clinical data request form serviced by University of Miami Information Technology. RESULTS: Five out of eight patients (62.5%) reported successful reductions in itch severity after treatment with butorphanol, two patients reported no (or transient) change in itch severity, and one patient reported a paradoxical increase in itching. Side effects included somnolence, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Butorphanol was safe and leads to clinically significant symptomatic improvement. Clinicians should be aware of butorphanol as an off-label treatment option for pruritus of cholestasis.

AIMS: We report a case of an elderly man with a severe long-standing AGA, which was successfully managed with microneedling and minoxidil. PATIENTS/METHODS: The patient was a 70-year-old Japanese man with family history of AGA, showed no abnormality in physical and laboratory examinations, and had received no treatment. We did monotherapy with 5% minoxidil twice daily to the right half of the scalp, while on the left half topical minoxidil was combined with weekly microneedling using an automated microneedling pen. RESULTS: After 14 weeks of treatment, negligible hair growth was observed on the monotherapy side. On the combined-therapy side, however, hair growth was obvious and the density of hairs determined under trichoscope was significantly increased compared with the monotherapy side (P < .001). Only transient pain, erythema, and pinpoint bleeding were observed as adverse effects.

Disease penetrance of desmoplakin variants is incomplete and variant carriers may display noncardiac, dermatologic phenotypes. We describe a novel cardiac phenotype associated with a truncating desmoplakin variant, likely causing mechanical instability of myocardial desmosomes. Methods and Results In 2 young brothers with recurrent myocarditis triggered by physical exercise, screening of 218 cardiomyopathy-related genes identified the heterozygous truncating variant p.Arg1458Ter in desmoplakin. Screening for infections yielded no evidence of viral or nonviral infections. Myosin and troponin I autoantibodies were detected at high titers. Immunohistology failed to detect any residual DSP protein in endomyocardial biopsies, and none of the histologic criteria of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy were fulfilled. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed no features associated with right ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, but multifocal subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement was present in the left ventricles of both brothers. Screening of adult cardiomyopathy cohorts for truncating variants identified the rare genetic variants p.Gln307Ter, p.Tyr1391Ter, and p.Tyr1512Ter, suggesting that over subsequent decades critical genetic/exogenous modifiers drive pathogenesis from desmoplakin truncations toward different end points. Conclusions The described novel phenotype of familial recurrent myocarditis associated with a desmoplakin truncation in adolescents likely represents a serendipitously revealed subtype of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. It may be caused by a distinctive adverse effect of the variant desmoplakin upon the mechanical stability of myocardial desmosomes.

In the three discussion paragraphs, we highlight that: 1) Triplet therapy is now standard first-line treatment for inoperable lung cancer. 2) TB reactivation is increasingly recognised as an adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibition, but sending diagnostic samples is critical to avoid a missed diagnosis. 3) These insights from novel cancer immunotherapies are challenging the traditional views of the host-pathogen interaction in TB, with wide implications for future control strategies. We propose that the cases reported in the literature are likely to be the tip of the iceberg as most people with lung cancer managed with antiprogrammed death-1 agents who develop new lung lesions will be treated with standard antibiotics and then palliated when they do not respond.",2020 Jul,20200514.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses tuberculosis associated with triplet therapy for lung cancer, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses tuberculosis associated with triplet therapy for lung cancer, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

However, the potential adverse effect of dabigatran of gastrointestinal mucosal injury is often neglected, and even induces esophagitis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of progressive retrosternal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, and dysphagia. DIAGNOSIS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed longitudinal sloughing mucosal casts in the distal esophagus. Histological examination showed squamous epithelium with neutrophil infiltration, partial epithelial degeneration, and Helicobacter pylori. Based on a literature review, medical history, and imaging examination, the patient was diagnosed with dabigatran-induced esophagitis.

Belimumab is not recommended for breastfeeding women due to insufficient data about its excretion into breast milk. In this study, we measured belimumab concentrations in the breast milk of one nursing mother diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and evaluated the health of her breastfed infant. Materials and Methods: Maternal serum and breast milk belimumab concentrations were collected three times (2 weeks after the first dose, the day after the second dose, and 7 weeks after the second dose) after ethical approval and informed consent. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect belimumab in serum and breast milk samples. Case Report: A 39-year-old para 4 female was diagnosed with MCTD. The serum concentrations at three times were 29.45, 76.82, and 33.95 mcg/mL. The concentrations in breast milk were 0.12, 0.17, and 0.12 mcg/mL. The milk-to-serum concentration ratios at each sampling point were 0.0041, 0.0022, and 0.0035, respectively. Her infant experienced no health problems. Routine vaccinations were administered without any adverse effects such as infection or immunoreaction. Discussion and Conclusions: Breast milk levels of belimumab ranged from 1/200 to 1/500 of those in serum, and no harmful effect occurred in her infant.

The diagnosis and treatment of OP or CM poisoning is traditionally based on the clinical appearance of the typical cholinergic toxidrome, e.g. miosis, salivation and bradycardia. Yet, clinical signs might be inconclusive or even misleading. A current case report highlights the importance of enzymatic assays to provide rapid information and support clinicians in diagnosis and rational clinical decision making. Furthermore, the differentiation between OP and CM poisoning seems important, as an oxime therapy will most probably not provide benefit in CM poisoning, but-as every pharmaceutical product-it might result in adverse effects. The early identification of the causing agent and the amount taken up in the body are helpful in planning of the therapeutic regimen including experimental strategies, e.g. the use of human blood products to facilitate scavenging of the toxic agent.

The specimen arrived in the laboratory at Cork University Hospital one day after collection, as documented on the paper request card, and was promptly centrifuged. Analysis was delayed for three days due to operational constraints and serum indices were run at the same time as the biochemical analyses. Results showed a moderately haemolysed specimen with remarkably low concentrations of both sodium (119 mmol/L) and total calcium (1.15 mmol/L), with all other parameters within their appropriate reference intervals (RIs). The complete report was released electronically and both sodium and calcium results were phoned to, and acknowledged by, the requesting general practitioner (GP). Discussion between the medical scientists and clinical biochemist on duty raised the possibility that the specimen was significantly older than initially thought. Further discussion of results with the GP clarified that the documented time of collection corresponded with specimen receipt by the courier, rather than the time of phlebotomy. Thus, the specimen was 7 days old when received in the laboratory and 10 days old when analysed. This case illustrates the dangers of multiple convergent preanalytical errors. Laboratories should be mindful of the stability of analytes in unseparated blood and unusual patterns of results which might suggest a specimen is ""old"", and that this may coexist with erroneous request information.

Commonly reported adverse effects are chills and fevers, which are usually associated with the first infusion. Recent studies have shown an association between rituximab use and low immunoglobulin (Ig) level due to a reduction in plasma cell precursors, which leads to an increased risk of infections with the use of rituximab. CASE REPORT We present a case of hypogammaglobulinemia associated with rituximab use in a patient with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA). A 59-year-old woman presented with shortness of breath. After an extensive workup, she was diagnosed with GPA. She received rituximab for the induction of remission. Laboratory workup, which was done five days after she received the second rituximab dose, showed IgG and IgM levels below the level of normal. One month after her second dose of rituximab, she presented to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as a transfer from an outside facility intubated and sedated due to acute respiratory failure secondary to septic shock with E. coli bacteremia. The patient died on admission despite aggressive management, including the ACLS protocol. CONCLUSIONS Rituximab is an effective medication in the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

Stress fractures could be seen in risc groups such as metabolic diseases/medications causing poor bone quality and exposing repetitive microtrauma. Anti-epileptic drug (AED) use is related with poor bone quality and increased fracture risc. Although carbamazepine-induced stress fracture is a well-known entity and there are case reports in other bones such as the femoral neck, bilateral calcaneal insufficiency fractures is an extraordinary location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting an insufficiency fracture involving calcaneus in the relevant literature. Due to the rarity of both conditions, we decided to present and discuss this patient. When patients receiving AED treatment present with heel pain without previous plantar fasciitis history or traumatic event, insufficiency fractures should be kept in mind. This case highlights the importance of screening adverse effect of CBZ on bone metabolism in patients with long CBZ use. We report here a 41-year-old lady suffering from bilateral heel pain without trauma history. Her complaining did not respond to analgesics and stretching exercises of plantar fascia. In her past medical history she reported ongoing carbamazepine (CBZ) use over 8 years for trigeminal neuralgia. She had had low bone mineral density; defined as osteopenia. Both calcaneus MRI revealed bilateral stress fractures of calcaneum. She had been advised immobilization for 6 weeks, vitamin D and calcium supplements. CBZ has been stopped by neurology specialist and she had undergone microvascular decompression surgery for intractable pain of trigeminal neuralgia. She is doing well with full recovery from heel pain and trigeminal neuralgia at the end of one year. CBZ use causes poor bone quality through vitamin D metabolism.

Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity, most likely caused by increased exposure, has recently become a major concern in clinical practice; therefore, appropriate dose reduction of cefepime should be applied with respect to patients with low cefepime clearance (mostly eliminated by the kidneys). Here, we report a case in which Bayesian prediction-based therapeutic drug monitoring (Bayes-TDM) was effectively used to reduce the dose of cefepime in a patient with pneumonia to prevent neurotoxic complications. A woman (age: 59 years, body weight: 32.5 kg, serum creatinine concentration: 1.02 mg/dL) developed pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa while receiving treatment for scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus. She started treatment with a dosing regimen of 1.0 g of cefepime every 8 h (day X). On day X+5, aphasia developed, and the serum cefepime concentration was 71.3 mg/L at trough. This concentration was twice or thrice higher than the reported safe concentration of cefepime (22 or 35 mg/L at trough). Therefore, we reduced the dose of cefepime to 0.5 g every 12 h using Bayes-TDM from day X+7. As a result, the severity of aphasia decreased by day X+10, and this dose was successfully continued up to day X+13 without further adjustment.

Maladaptive health behaviors ultimately increase the risk for developing adverse effects, including: increased rates of morbidity and mortality, impaired physical functioning, increased fatigue, obesity, increased psychological distress, and poor quality of life. With close attention including participation in preventive and therapeutic health promotion interventions, problematic health behaviors can be mitigated and ultimately prevented over time. It is well known that improved psychological functioning and adaptive coping can result in improved health status. The present paper provides four case examples illustrating various psychological interventions in pediatric chronic illness. As evidenced in the four case examples, pediatric psychologists provide comprehensive interventions for patients with acute and chronic medical conditions through the use of health promotion interventions, adherence and self-management promotion, cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, medical coping, parent training, and motivational interviewing.

The most reported adverse effects include fatigue, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy, which mostly manifests as sensory neuropathic symptoms. We present a case of a patient who experienced motor neuropathy after initiating treatment with bortezomib. CASE REPORT: An 87-year-old male was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and started on treatment with bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide (VRd). After five cycles of therapy, he developed lower extremity weakness, which was severely debilitating, affecting his ability to walk, and this prompted his visit to the emergency department. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient was admitted for further workup and underwent electromyography, which was consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy with active denervation. His symptoms were attributed to bortezomib, and his VRd regimen was held. His symptoms failed to improve despite discontinuation of bortezomib. He then received steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IViG) with a gradual resolution of his symptoms. He was thereafter restarted on only lenalidomide and dexamethasone with no recurrence of his neuropathy. DISCUSSION: Clinicians need to be aware of the likely risk for motor neuropathy associated with bortezomib. Risk factors like older age and pre-existing neuropathy can predispose patients to this adverse effect, and clinicians should monitor for this toxicity and facilitate dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy if warranted. Sometimes, patients may also need further treatment with steroids or IVIG.",2020 Sep,20200213.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of bortezomib, specifically motor neuropathy, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of bortezomib, specifically motor neuropathy, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,90,,
32043370,,Prostaglandin analogues: A double-edged sword in orbital glaucoma disease management.,Joganathan V||Cannon PS||Mercieca K,"INTRODUCTION: The authors describe benefits of the recognised adverse effects of prostaglandin analogues on periocular structures in patients with unilateral proptosis and intraocular pressure rise. This case points to intentional consideration of prostaglandin analogue therapy in this selected cohort of patients with secondary ocular hypertension and proptosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old gentleman who presented with a 1-week history of a red and painful right eye associated with tortuous and dilated episcleral blood vessels. Visual acuity was unaffected. A diagnosis of idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease was made by extraocular muscle biopsy. Two weeks later, the patient presented with worsening pain, reduced vision and raised intraocular pressure. The secondary ocular hypertension was successfully treated with topical preserved eye drops, including latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue. Over 6 months, the patient developed drop intolerance and punctate keratopathy leading to therapy non-adherence. Interestingly, the patient reported improvement in periocular appearance related to prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy. Ocular surface disease and intraocular pressures were subsequently managed with preservative-free eye drops. CONCLUSION: Secondary ocular hypertension is not an uncommon consequence of orbital disease. Prostaglandin analogue can act as a double-edged sword in the management of raised intraocular pressure by reducing eye pressure at the cost of developing adverse effects of prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy. These adverse effects however can be beneficial in the aesthetic rehabilitation of proptosis and associated exposure keratopathy in patients with unilateral orbital disease and probably should be sought as first line treatment in those with proptosis and raised intraocular pressure.",2021 May,20200211.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effects of prostaglandin analogues in the context of ocular hypertension and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the effects of prostaglandin analogues in the context of ocular hypertension and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
32034497,,Subthalamic stimulation for cervical dystonia.,Gupta A,"The globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been the primary target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat severe medication-refractory dystonia. Some patients with primary cervical dystonia do not respond adequately to GPi stimulation. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS may provide an alternative choice for treating this dystonia. In this study, we analysed the effect of bilateral STN DBS on two patients of medically refractory primary cervical dystonia. The severity of the dystonia was measured using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) preoperatively, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively and yearly follow-up was performed. Any change in mental status was recorded using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Surgery was performed using the Leksell stereotactic system and by fusing CT scan and MR images with neuronavigation and microelectrode recording. Both patients were followed for more than 3 years. STN DBS was well-tolerated by both patients with no adverse effects. The benefit seems to be immediate. The first patient showed 74% improvement, and the second patient showed 84.3% improvement in the overall TWSTRS score. No mental deterioration was observed in either of the cases, as the MMSE score remained unchanged in both patients. A prior bilateral pallidal lesion in the first case did not adversely affect the outcome. This study showed that bilateral STN DBS results in a very significant improvement in cervical dystonia with no mental worsening and suggests that STN DBS may be an alternative to GPi DBS for treating primary cervical dystonia.",2020 Aug,20200207.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses the effects of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on cervical dystonia, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses the effects of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on cervical dystonia, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

31977867,PMC7004584,Severe peripheral arterial diseases in hemodialysis patient: A case report.,Li J||Yan M||Qin J||Liu J||Wen R,"RATIONALE: Peripheral arterial diseases (PADs) is defined as a systemic arterial disorders involving the lower extremity arteries, iliac, and carotid, which is developed more common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than individual with normal renal function. Concurrence of mesenteric artery disease and lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) is rare. The presence of PADs in patients receiving hemodialysis leads to a dramatic increase in risk of cardiovascular mortality. However, the early diagnosis of PADs in patient with CKD remains a challenge to nephrologists, which adds an adverse effect on prognosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old man received regular hemodialysis due to end-stage renal failure caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for 7 years, who was admitted into hospital for acute, severe rest pain of the right lower extremity at the first time. The computed tomography angiography showed severe, diffuse stenosis of the distal third of femoral artery. After discharged, he was readmitted into hospital for abdominal pain and the recurred right lower limb pain. A diagnostic angiography confirmed the initial occlusion of superior mesenteric artery, severe obstruction of the distal segment of femoral artery and diffuse, irregular stenosis of arteria peronea and arteria tibialis posterior. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as PADs including LEAD and mesenteric artery disease. INTERVENTIONS: The percutaneous transulminal angioplasty (PTA) combined with antiplatelet therapy and beraprost were performed. Moreover, the cinacalcet and lanthanum carbonate were prescribed to control calcium-phosphorus- parathyroid hormone metabolism. OUTCOMES: The patient was free of abdominal pain and partly relieved from the ache of lower limb after PTA. However, he finally succumbed to acute myocardial infarction. LESSONS: The incidence of PADs is higher in dialysis patients due to a unique set of biochemical and endocrine abnormalities. As there is a high uremic status and PADs burden in patients with hemodialysis, the short term risk of cardiovascular disesase mortality markedly increases. There is a need for nephrologists and cardiovascular physicians to identify these patients and then provide early and proper treatment.",2020 Jan,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses severe peripheral arterial diseases in a hemodialysis patient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses severe peripheral arterial diseases in a hemodialysis patient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,

Sometimes several undesired events may occur in a single patient, reminding us of Murphy's law. Herein, we report a case which exemplifies this adage. A 50-year-old female developed PJP, while on methotrexate therapy for RA and was treated with cotrimoxazole.

And, it's essential to assessing the relationship between nitrate pollution and human health, which is called human health risk assessment (HHRA). In this paper, groundwater samples were collected for their nitrate content in a typical karst hydrogeological unit in East China during the wet and dry seasons. Then, a human health risk assessment was conducted using the four-step risk assessment process developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), which aimed to determine the potential risk posed to human health by nitrate in the groundwater. To make the assessment more authentic and objective, the drinking water and dermal contact exposure pathways were considered, and the people were divided into four groups, including infants (0~6 months), children (7 months~17 years old), females (18 years and older), and males (18 years and older), in the wet and dry seasons to determine the impacts of the exposure pathway, age, sex, and precipitation period. The results indicated that more than half of the groundwater samples exceeded 10 mg/L (measured as nitrogen), which is the drinking water standard of China. The children and infants had greater health risks than the adults at the same groundwater nitrate concentration, and those two groups need to be paid more attention; the adult females had a greater health risk than the adult males in the two precipitation periods, which shows that the order of the health risk was infants > children > adult females > adult males. In addition, the value of the hazard quotient (HQ) and the area of the adverse effects were both higher in the wet season than in the dry season, which explains that precipitation can affect the human health risk as well. The HQ caused by the drinking water exposure pathway was much higher than that caused by the dermal contact exposure pathway.

Giving the rapid pace of drug discovery and development in this area, reporting of adverse effects of ALK inhibitors is crucial. Here, we report a case of osteitis induced by an ALK inhibitor mimicking bone metastasis, a previously undescribed side effect of crizotinib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old woman with stage IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC presented with back pain after 3 months of crizotinib treatment. Diagnostic work-up showed osteitis on the 4th and 5th thoracic vertebrae, anterior soft tissue infiltration and epiduritis, without any sign of infection. Spinal cord decompression, histological removal and osteosynthesis were performed. Histologic examination showed necrosis with abundant peripheral neutrophils, no microorganism nor malignant cell. Symptoms and Computarized Tomography-abnormalities rapidly diseappeared after crizotinib withdrawal and did not recur after ceritinib onset. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of crizotinib-induced osteitis.

These agents inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation and invasion. Dysphonia, or voice changes, has been documented, but is an underreported side effect of anti-angiogenic agents. We report a case of intermittent dysphonia in a patient with metastatic, platinum-refractory ovarian cancer treated with bevacizumab. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old female with high grade mixed type ovarian adenocarcinoma and concurrent left sided breast cancer was transitioned to palliative therapy with gemcitabine-bevacizumab for her ovarian cancer. At a follow-up visit after three cycles of the new therapy, the patient complained of intermittent changes in her voice, describing periods of hoarseness or softness in her voice after the chemotherapy-sometimes to the point that her voice was inaudible. Management and outcome: A new pelvic thrombus was discovered upon assessment of the patient's disease. Bevacizumab was held and she was referred to ear, nose, and throat evaluation for dysphonia. Laryngoscopic examination showed normal vocal cord, with normal movements and no lesion or necrosis. During subsequent follow-up, the patient reported improvement in her voice with no additional dysphonia. DISCUSSION: Vocal adverse effects of anti-VEGF agents have been documented in landmark trials and case reports; however, clinicians are often unaware of this rare side effect.

Active compounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, cause mild stimulant and opioid agonist effects. Although reported to have potential benefits in the treatment of opioid use disorder, efficacy remains uncertain while adverse health effects have been reported. A compounding concern is the presence of adulterants given that this is an unregulated product. CASE DETAILS: A 54-year-old fitness instructor who used an online purchased kratom product regularly for one year developed stimulatory effects and suffered a large hemorrhagic stroke with a close temporal relationship to ingestion of a different kratom product from the one he regularly used. A collaborative investigation by medical toxicologists, a regional poison center, the state public health laboratory, and public health officials determined that his new kratom product was adulterated with phenylethylamine (PEA). DISCUSSION: We report a case of PEA adulterated kratom purchased and used with resultant adverse effects. PEA is structurally similar to amphetamine and is known to produce sympathomimetic effects.

Although mTOR inhibitors are usually well tolerated, their adverse effects have been reported: sirolimus treatment in transplant patients has been rarely reported to be associated with lymphedema of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas the use of everolimus seemed to be less burdened by this type of adverse effect. We report the case of a 58-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology who had undergone right renal transplantation 11 years before. After the transplant, the patient soon developed bilateral progressive swelling involving feet and legs. The symptoms of the left limb improved markedly after discontinuing everolimus. This condition has been classified as everolimus-induced lymphedema. The patient was referred to our department for the execution of a noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography, that is, a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging technique that has recently proposed for the study of lymphedema. Noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography showed asymmetry between the lower extremities with signs of advanced lymphedema located in the right lower limb and dilated peripheral lymphatic vessels.Drug withdrawal is currently the only effective solution for treating this type of secondary lymphedema; however, with the prolonged use of the drug, lymphedema tends to persist even after mTOR inhibitor suspension, with only partial clinical improvement, as in this case.This case report describes the imaging characteristics of such condition at noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography and discusses the rare adverse effects of everolimus.

METHODS: Retrospective case report with fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography. RESULTS: A 65-year-old woman presented with symptoms of photopsia and visual field loss. She had previously undergone ipilimumab/nivolumab combination chemotherapy treatment for malignant melanoma 14 months earlier coinciding with the onset of her visual symptoms. Fundus photography showed bilateral atrophic chorioretinal lesions and peripheral retinal pigment epithelial changes. Fluorescein angiography revealed retinovascular leakage in both eyes with CNV in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography showed a pigment epithelial detachment with subretinal fluid and subretinal hyperreflective material consistent with occult CNV. Visual field testing showed generalized visual field loss in both eyes. Bloodwork discovered an elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme. Electroretinography revealed abnormal peripheral rod and cone function with impairment of the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layer. Serum Western blot was positive for 60 kDa antiretinal autoantibody.

We present the unique case of a patient that developed an invasive NPM while under treatment with a combination of vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab. A 39-year-old white male was treated with vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab for a stage IV (T0, N3, M1) BRAF-V600E mutated malignant melanoma in the context of a clinical trial. Eight months from treatment initiation he was diagnosed with an NPM on his back that was found to be BRAF-wild type and neuroblastoma ras mutated, while he was in complete remission. Wide excision of the lesion followed, and the patient was not withdrawn from study treatment. Twenty-two months from treatment initiation, he is still in complete remission. NPMs are a well-known adverse effect of BRAF inhibitors and pose a challenge for the treating physician since these lesions are BRAF-wild type and usually have aggressive biologic behaviour. Invasive NPMs require an aggressive management strategy with clear guidelines to prevent the emergence of advanced or metastatic disease. The emergence of invasive NPMs in patients treated with triple regimens with BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors and PD1/PDL1 inhibitors is at least unexpected and constitutes a therapeutic stalemate for the physician.

This case report aims to illustrate the efficacy of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach in managing painful diabetic neuropathy complicated by OIH. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old male patient presented to the Pain Treatment Clinic with severe lower limb pain due to diabetic polyneuropathy. He had a history of multiple comorbidities. DIAGNOSES: The patient's condition and physical examination suggested the presence of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Despite the increased dose of opioids, the patient did not report significant constipation or breathing difficulties but experienced drowsiness and dry mouth. A diagnosis of opioid and benzodiazepine dependence was made. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment plan involved the initiation of pregabalin and duloxetine, gradual reduction of opioid use, and psychiatric support for addiction management. OUTCOMES: Over 12 months, the patient experienced significant pain reduction and minimal adverse effects. LESSONS: Effective management of OIH involves gradual opioid tapering and a multimodal therapeutic approach.

In contrast to primary dystonia, secondary forms of dystonia are often associated with lesions in the putamen or globus pallidus. Such disorders are commonly neurodegenerative or neurometabolic conditions which produce varied neurologic as well as systemic manifestations other than dystonia. Chemo-denervation with botulinum toxin has been successfully used for focal or segmental dystonia. However, studies evaluating the effect of BoNT therapy on patients with secondary dystonia are sparse, given the heterogeneity in etiology and presentation. METHODS: We present a series of patients with secondary dystonia who were managed with botulinum toxin therapy. Patients included in this series had a confirmed neurometabolic cause of dystonia. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients, with ages ranging from 17 to 36 years, with disorders including Wilson's disease, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), glutaric aciduria type 1, Sanfilippo syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIb), and GM2 gangliosidosis (Sandhoff disease) are presented.

Although hematological effects, especially neutropenia, are one of the main complications of other oral antineoplastic drugs, these adverse effects are infrequent in the case of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a patient diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who discontinued an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor due to drug-related grade 4 neutropenia. His control blood counts before enzalutamide starting were normal. After one month of treatment, he developed a grade 4 neutropenia, with complete neutrophil count recovery four weeks later. He underwent a bone marrow aspiration, which revealed normocelullar results, and enzalutamide was restarted. Three weeks later, the treatment was eventually discontinued due to neutropenia reappearance. Neutrophil count recovery was achieved one month later. Then, he started treatment with abiraterone, but two weeks later neutropenia reappeared. Abiraterone was withdrawn, and the patient recovered from neutropenia 2 weeks later. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: This case exposes not only the occurrence of rare toxicity of two individual drugs but also the description of a probable drug-class adverse event not reported before. The patient recovered from neutropenia after the androgen receptor pathway inhibitor was withdrawn, thereby supporting the diagnosis of probable drug-induced neutropenia. DISCUSSION: There is scarce evidence in the literature concerning androgen receptor pathway inhibitor-related neutropenia. However, its life-threatening potential cannot be ignored, so healthcare professionals should be warned of the possibility of the occurrence of such adverse reactions.",2024 Oct,20240723.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on neutropenia caused by prostate cancer drugs.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on neutropenia caused by prostate cancer drugs.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses complications related to neutropenia caused by specific cancer treatments, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The input item discusses complications related to neutropenia caused by specific cancer treatments, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

Pregnancy was complicated by transient oligohydramnios, and fetal magnetic resonance imaging suggested renal failure. Despite these concerns, the newborn had no morphological abnormalities or abnormal neurological findings. Renal impairment improved over time, and the infant grew well. A single overdose of ARBs in the third trimester can lead to fetal renal failure, similar to long-term low-dose ARB administration; however, favorable outcomes are possible.

38887138,,The robotic-assisted free jejunal flap for neovaginal canal creation in gender-affirming vaginoplasties.,Del Corral GA||Chang BL||Lava CX||Li KR||Lisle DM,"INTRODUCTION: One of the biggest challenges with gender-affirming vaginoplasty was the creation of a long-lasting, durable, patent, and self-lubricating neovaginal canal that allowed for spontaneous, pain-free sexual intercourse. The jejunum was a durable, physiologic, and intestinal option to create the neovaginal canal that minimizes the adverse effects of skin graft, peritoneal, and colonic vaginoplasties. Free jejunal vaginoplasties had been performed in cis females for congenital genitourinary anomalies like Mullerian agenesis or after gynecologic-oncologic surgery but had yet to be reported for gender-affirming vaginoplasties. The purpose of this report was to present a technique for a physiologic, intestinal, gender-affirming vaginoplasty without the disadvantages of colonic vaginoplasties. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report presented six patients, all natal males who identified as female, undergoing robotic-assisted free jejunal flap gender-affirming vaginoplasty. Mean age was 35.8 years (range: 21-66). Mean body mass index was 33.2 kg/m(2) (range: 28.0-41.0). The proximal aspect of the neovaginal canal was created intra-abdominally by elevating peritoneal flaps from the posterior bladder wall to be reflected downward into the external neovaginal canal. The jejunal flap was harvested. The greater saphenous vein was harvested to create an arteriovenous loop between the flap vessels and the recipient femoral artery in an end-to-side fashion and a branch of the femoral vein. The jejunal flap was passed intra-abdominally through the groin incision and then trans-peritoneally into the neovaginal canal. The jejunal segment was inset to the proximal peritoneal flaps and the distal inverted penoscrotal skin of the neovaginal introitus. RESULTS: Mean length of the harvest jejunal segment was 19.2 cm (range: 15-20). Mean time to ambulation, foley removal, and first vaginal dilation were 3.3 (range: 3-4), 4.0 (range: 3-5), and 4.5 days (range: 4-6), respectively. By a mean follow-up duration of 8.0 months (range: 1-14), mean vaginal depth and diameter were 7.0 and 1.3 cm (range: 1.0-1.5), respectively. Two (33.3%) patients experienced postoperative complications, including groin hematoma (n = 1, 16.7%) and reoperation for correction of dehiscence of the jejunal flap to the vaginal introitus (n = 1, 16.7%).

Diverse neurologic syndromes, including the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), an immune-mediated disease characterized by evolving ascending limb weakness, sensory loss, and areflexia, have been described in association with anti-TNF-alpha therapy. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old White woman was in follow-up with fistulizing ileocolonic Crohn disease using combination therapy (infliximab plus azathioprine) as CD maintenance therapy. After 3 years of this immunosuppressive therapy, she presented with symmetrical and ascending paresis in the lower limbs, and later in the upper limbs, in addition to reduced reflexes in the knees, 1 day after an infliximab infusion. The patient was hospitalized and treatment for CD was suspended. Neurophysiology studies demonstrated a pattern compatible with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, with predominantly motor involvement, consistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging exams were unremarkable. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, with a progressive and complete resolution of neurological symptoms. After 1-year follow-up, she presented with active Crohn disease, and we opted for treating her with vedolizumab, with which she achieved clinical and endoscopic remission. CONCLUSIONS Patients receiving biological therapy with anti-TNF-alpha agents should be monitored for central or peripheral neurological signs and symptoms.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers an alternative approach to standard pharmacological and surgical interventions, which are often associated with adverse side effects. This case report details the clinical remission of a 50-year-old male with moderate generalized MG following exclusive treatment with a modified Buzhong Yiqi decoction (BYD), a TCM formula, without the use of immunosuppressive agents. CASE SUMMARY: The patient presented with diplopia, bilateral ptosis, weakness in chewing, limb weakness, and other symptoms indicative of spleen and stomach qi deficiency. Modified BYD was prescribed, focusing on strengthening the spleen, nourishing qi and blood, and enhancing immune response. The treatment included ingredients such as Radix Astragali, Angelica sinensis, Atractylodes macrocephala, and others, aiming to restore balance and improve the patient's condition. After two weeks of TCM treatment, the patient showed significant improvement in symptoms of myasthenia. By the second month, all clinical symptoms had disappeared. The patient continued to receive the TCM regimen until the thirtieth month of treatment. At the time of writing this report, the patient has no clinical symptoms and has experienced no relapse. Notably, no obvious adverse effects were reported throughout the treatment. CONCLUSION: The success of this case suggests that TCM may serve as an independent treatment option for moderate MG, offering a steroid-free alternative, which would be particularly valuable for patients who are intolerant of or refuse steroid therapy, potentially with significant clinical implications.

We first reported a case of ALI caused by PEG-rhG-CSF in a healthy Chinese donor, characterized by hemoptysis, hypoxemia, and patchy shadows. Ultimately, hormone administration, planned PBSC collection, leukocyte debridement, and planned PBSC collection resulted in active control of the donor's ALI. The donor's symptoms improved without any adverse effects, and the PBSC collection proceeded without incident. Over time, the lung lesion was gradually absorbed and eventually returned to normal.

Immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) of ICIs vary widely in presentation and symptoms and can present diagnostic challenges to emergency department (ED) physicians. Moreover, when ICIs are combined with radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or targeted therapy, the attribution of signs and symptoms to an immune-related cause is even more difficult. Here, we report a series of 5 ED cases of adrenal insufficiency in ICI-treated cancer patients. All 5 patients presented with severe fatigue and nausea. Four patients definitely had and one patient possibly had central adrenal insufficiency, and 4 patients had undetectable serum cortisol levels. The majority of the patients had nonspecific symptoms that were not recognized at their first ED presentation. These cases illustrate the need for a heightened level of suspicion for adrenal insufficiency in ICI-treated cancer patients with hypotension, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, or hypoglycemia. As ICI use increases, irAE-associated oncologic emergencies will become more prevalent. Thus, ED physicians must update their knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of irAEs and routinely inquire about the specific antineoplastic therapies that their ED patients with cancer are receiving.

Typically, their adverse effects are gastrointestinal, with limited exploration into their impact on mental health. CASE PRESENTATION: This report examines a 39-year-old male with type 2 diabetes who developed depressive symptoms after starting liraglutide for glycemic control and weight reduction. Symptoms included poor mood, irritability, decreased interest and energy, progressing to sadness, low self-esteem, and physical discomfort. A clinical diagnosis of a depressive episode was made, coinciding with the initiation of liraglutide. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient depressive symptoms significantly improved within a week after discontinuing liraglutide and starting antidepressant therapy. This suggests a possible link between liraglutide and depression, despite considering other factors like diabetes-related stress. DISCUSSION: The report explores potential mechanisms, such as GLP-1RA effects on glucose fluctuations and dopamine modulation, which might contribute to depressive symptoms. The influence on the brain reward system and the reduction in cravings for addictive substances after GLP-1RA use is also discussed as a factor in mood regulation.

A personalized approach to testing clinical parameters and response to integrative treatment with nontoxic and bioavailable melatonin in patient-centered N-of-1 studies deserves greater attention. This clinical case of colon cancer analyzes and discusses the tumor pathology, the adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the dynamics of markers of inflammation (NLR, LMR, and PLR ratios), tumors (CEA, CA 19-9, and PSA), and hemostasis (D-dimer and activated partial thromboplastin time). The patient took melatonin during and after chemotherapy, nutrients (zinc, selenium, vitamin D, green tea, and taxifolin), and aspirin after chemotherapy. The patient's PSA levels decreased during CT combined with melatonin (19 mg/day), and melatonin normalized inflammatory markers and alleviated symptoms of polyneuropathy but did not help with thrombocytopenia.

Its incidence is higher in children and young adults than in older adults of both genders, but is more common in women than in men. ON is rarely associated with mydriasis, and it is seldom triggered by vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old Caucasian woman presented with bilateral ON that had started 18 days after administration of a booster dose of the double adult vaccine (dT) against diphtheria and tetanus. Bilateral mydriasis persisted after treatment and clinical resolution of the ON. She experienced severe headache, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity in the right eye and bilateral mydriasis, a diagnosis confirmed by imaging tests. Treatment with oral corticosteroids resulted in rapid resolution of the neuritis; however, mydriasis persisted for several months. CONCLUSION: This study describes a very unusual case of bilateral ON associated with prolonged mydriasis after vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria that regressed after treatment with oral corticosteroids.

38646529,PMC11026605,Case report: A rare immune-related adverse effect: hepatic cavernous hemangioma induced by camrelizumab.,Zhang C||Wang G||Liu N||Li T||Zhu J||Hou H,"BACKGROUND: Camrelizumab, a programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibiting antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in various malignancies and received approval in multiple countries. Despite its therapeutic benefits, camrelizumab is associated with a unique spectrum of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), predominantly reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP). However, visceral manifestations of such endothelial proliferations, particularly hepatic cavernous hemangiomas, have not been extensively documented. METHODS: This case series retrospectively reviews six patients who developed hepatic hemangiomas following treatment with camrelizumab in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. The series highlights the clinical course, imaging findings, management strategies, and outcomes associated with this complication. A detailed analysis was conducted to discern the potential causal relationship between camrelizumab therapy and the development of hepatic hemangiomas. RESULTS: All six patients, after varying cycles of camrelizumab-based therapy, presented with hepatic lesions identified as cavernous hemangiomas on imaging. These findings were atypical for metastatic disease and were further complicated by significant clinical events, including massive intra-abdominal bleeding post-biopsy. Discontinuation of camrelizumab led to a reduction in the size of the hemangiomas in two cases, suggesting a potential link between the drug and the development of these vascular lesions. The incidence of RCCEP remained high, and the use of other agents such as bevacizumab did not mitigate the occurrence of hepatic hemangiomas, indicating a possible unique pathogenic mechanism associated with camrelizumab. CONCLUSION: Hepatic cavernous hemangioma may represent a rare but clinically significant irAE associated with camrelizumab therapy. This series underscores the importance of vigilant monitoring and a high index of suspicion for atypical hepatic lesions in patients undergoing treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiology of this complication and to establish guidelines for the management and surveillance of patients receiving camrelizumab.",2024,20240405.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses immune-related adverse effects associated with camrelizumab therapy, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses immune-related adverse effects associated with camrelizumab therapy, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
38625840,PMC11034389,Nivolumab-Induced Cytokine Release Syndrome: A Case Report and Literature Review.,Ntwali F||Gilliaux Q||Honore PM,"BACKGROUND CRS (cytokine release syndrome) is a massive activation of the inflammatory system characterized by a supra-physiological rate of inflammatory cytokines. The interleukin 6 cytokine plays a central role in CRS. The main clinical sign of CRS is fever, but CRS can lead to multiple organ failure in severe cases. CRS is usually described in sepsis, more recently in SARS COV-2 infection, and in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. However, it can also be associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which is infrequently described. ICI have growing indications and can lead to CRS by causing an uncontrolled activation of the immune system. There are currently no treatment guidelines for ICI-induced CRS. CASE REPORT We report a rare case of grade 3 CRS induced by nivolumab associated with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin for gastric cancer. The patient was 65-year-old man with an adenocarcinoma of the cardia. CRS developed during the tenth course of treatment and was characterized by fever, hypotension requiring vasopressors, hypoxemia, acute kidney injury, and thrombopenia. The patient was transferred quickly to the Intensive Care Unit. He was treated for suspected sepsis, but it was ruled out after multiple laboratory examinations. There was rapid resolution after infusion of hydrocortisone. CONCLUSIONS The use of ICIs is expanding. Nivolumab-induced CRS is rarely described but can be severe and lead to multiple organ dysfunction; therefore, intensive care practitioners should be informed about this adverse effect.

Tislelizumab, a novel humanized Ig G4 programmed death receptor 1 inhibitor, was started for bladder cancer in 2019, but the adverse effects of this drug may not yet be known due to its short time on the market, and there are still some clinical safety concerns. There are few reports of adrenal insufficiency after tislelizumab treatment, which is easily missed, misdiagnosed and life-threatening. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 67-year-old male with bladder cancer who developed rash, water-sodium retention, electrolyte disturbances, hypoalbuminemia, low-grade fever, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue after 2 cycles of tislelizumab. DIAGNOSIS: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adrenal hypofunction and Psoriasisby. INTERVENTIONS: Suspended tislelizumab treatment and continued glucocorticoid therapy. OUTCOMES: The patient showed significant improvement in the above symptoms. But bladder cancer reemerged at the same site. CONCLUSIONS: The advent of immune-related adverse events has increased the complexity of the application of tislelizumab in the treatment of bladder cancer and further research is needed to develop the best treatment guidelines.

Fractional, or fractionated, carbon dioxide (CO(2)) laser therapy uses narrow shafts of light to smooth the skin surface and stimulate dermal collagen, which tightens the skin. This case report describes a 57-year-old woman with a traumatic hypertrophic scar of the face treated with fractional carbon dioxide laser therapy. The purpose of this case report was to highlight the role of fractional CO(2) laser therapy in treatment of a facial traumatic hypertrophic scar in a patient after a motor vehicle crash. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old female patient presented with a hypertrophic, rigid, post-traumatic scar on the left side of her face following a motor vehicle crash. For the hypertrophic scar removal, the patient underwent 1 treatment session with fractional CO(2) laser using the micro-Scan DOT scanning system. After 1 laser treatment session, the photographic documentation, which permits monitoring the treatment's effectiveness in esthetic improvement, showed a significant improvement in scar texture and color. In addition, a significant reduction in scar height was observed following laser therapy. Fractional laser treatment with the device was very well tolerated by the patient, who reported no pain or discomfort, complications, or adverse effects either during treatment or in the follow-up period (3 months).

Despite its efficacy, clozapine is associated with adverse effects, notably neutropenia and agranulocytosis. Other hematological adverse effects are less common. Severe anemia is a rare adverse effect seldom reported in the literature and is typically associated with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Nevertheless, the benefits of clozapine in managing TRS make rechallenge a reasonable option. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 35-year-old man with TRS, resistant to previous antipsychotics, who experienced severe anemia during clozapine treatment. An investigation for clozapine-induced anemia revealed PRCA on myelogram. After discontinuing clozapine, the patient's hemoglobin levels recovered. Subsequent treatments with olanzapine, zuclopenthixol, and aripiprazole proved ineffective, leading us to consider a clozapine rechallenge. The rechallenge, monitored for 58 days, resulted in improved psychiatric symptoms and stable hemoglobin levels. The patient remained stable during 6 months of follow-up, with no hematological changes. DISCUSSION: PRCA is a very rare adverse effect of clozapine. The cause of drug-induced PRCA is still unknown; for clozapine, there are no studies. Rechallenge after a severe and rare adverse effect is a complex decision. This case is the first to report a successful clozapine rechallenge following severe anemia without other blood dyscrasias, emphasizing the imperative need for close monitoring during the rechallenge process. Further study is warranted to understand the predictive factors for a successful outcome in clozapine rechallenges.",2024 Apr 30,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on clozapine-induced anemia, not COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on clozapine-induced anemia, not COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses clozapine and its adverse effects, specifically severe anemia, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses clozapine and its adverse effects, specifically severe anemia, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

As exercise tolerance in these patients is low and weight gain is a common adverse effect of corticosteroids, bariatric surgery can be an effective method for the management of obesity in this patient group. However, perioperative complications in such high-risk patients remain a concern. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate successful anesthetic management for obese patients with ILD, which may be practically utilized to reduce perioperative pulmonary complications and improve outcomes. CASE REPORT Our case report presents a 42-year-old man with ILD who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Preoperative studies revealed severe restrictive disease, right ventricular overload with assessed intermediate risk of pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure, with preserved left ventricle fraction but with poor exercise tolerance. Patient had opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) and postoperative multimodal analgesia. Following a 24-h stay in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient was transferred to the ward and ultimately discharged home 2 days thereafter. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient reduced his weight by 40 kg and reported a significant improvement in physical capacity. CONCLUSIONS Our record demonstrates that OFA can be successfully used in high-risk patients with ILD undergoing LSG. In a period of a year, the patient improved so much that he no longer required lung transplantation, which may encourage clinicians to provide bariatric surgery using the OFA technique in the population of patients with obesity and severe respiratory illness.",2024 Mar 19,20240319.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on anesthetic management for obese patients with interstitial lung disease undergoing surgery, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on anesthetic management for obese patients with interstitial lung disease undergoing surgery, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses anesthetic management for obese patients with interstitial lung disease undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses anesthetic management for obese patients with interstitial lung disease undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

38423865,,Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis-Is This on Your Radar?,Simon EL||Sherry AC||Rabinowitz J,"BACKGROUND: Metformin is a biguanide hyperglycemic agent used to manage non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Adverse reactions include mainly mild gastrointestinal adverse effects, but severe complications, such as metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) can occur. Metformin is excreted renally and, therefore, not recommended in patients with renal impairment. The reported incidence of MALA is 3 cases per 100,000 patient-years. CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease on dialysis and type 2 diabetes, presented to the emergency department (ED) for altered mental status. Prior to arrival, she was found to be hypoglycemic. Her laboratory results were significant for creatinine of 6.56 mg/dL and an anion gap of 52 mmol/L. The venous blood gas revealed a venous pH of 6.857 [reference range (7.32-7.43)], pCO(2) of 15.9 mm Hg (40.6-60 mm Hg), HCO(3) of 2.7 mmol/L (21-30 mmol/L), lactate of 27 mmol/L (0.5-2 mmol/L), and ammonia of 233 micromol/L. The patient was dialyzed emergently in the ED; repeat laboratory test results showed blood urea nitrogen of 10 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.65 mg/dL, carbon dioxide of 26 mmol/L, and anion gap of 13 mmol/L. The repeat ammonia was 16 micromol/L. The patient's metabolic encephalopathy resolved, and she was discharged home on hospital day 3. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: MALA has a high mortality rate (36%). Laboratory markers have not been found to be a reliable predictor of mortality. Sodium bicarbonate is controversial, but a pH < 7.15 indicates consideration of its use. A pH < 7.1 and a lactate level > 20 mmol/L indicate the need for emergent hemodialysis.

However, several adverse effects have been documented and of great interest such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of case reports and case series describing the development of SLE following COVID-19 against vaccination. METHODS: Case report and case series studies were included. Systematic reviews, narratives, letters to the editor, correspondence, etc. were excluded. A selective bibliographic search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. In addition, the Web of Science platform was consulted. The Joanna Brigs Institute (JBI) tool was used to assess the risk of bias and quality of the studies. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 23.0 was used for the formal analysis of the descriptive data. RESULTS: 12 studies met the eligibility criteria and reported a total of 16 patients. The mean age was 42.4 +/- 18.69 years. A slight predominance of post-vaccination SLE was observed in females (females (n = 9) and males (n = 7). A higher association was found with Pfizer-BioNTech-162b2 vaccine (75%), followed by Sinopharm (12.5%), Moderna (6.25%). and AstraZeneca (6.25%) vaccines. Most cases were associated with the first dose (56.25%), followed by the second dose (37.5%) and only one case associated with the third dose. The number of days elapsed from vaccine administration to the appearance of the first clinical manifestations was between 1 and 30 days.

38302876,PMC10835811,Case report: a unique presentation of memantine overdose causing echolalia and hypertension.,Durrani S||Ahmed S,"BACKGROUND: Since 2003 when memantine was first approved for use in the management of moderate-severe Alzheimer's dementia, its use has become more widespread and is being explored in other diseases like neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and mood disorders. Our case uniquely highlights two important adverse effects in a patient who overdosed on memantine. One is hypertension, which is easy to overlook as a medication side effect. The other is echolalia which is the repetition of words and phrases spoken by another person. It is commonly seen in children with autism spectrum disorder and has been reported in older adults with head injuries, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders. The aim of this patient story is to highlight the importance of medication reconciliation with caregivers and knowledge of adverse drug reactions in patient management. This case report has been presented previously in the form of an abstract at the American Geriatrics Society Presidential poster session in May 2023. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is an 86-year-old man with mild dementia and hypertension, who was brought to the emergency department (ED) due to abrupt onset of altered mental status and auditory hallucinations. Investigations including blood work, CT head and an electroencephalogram (EEG) did not reveal an etiology for this change in his condition. Due to elevated blood pressure on presentation, a nicardipine drip was started, and he was given IV midazolam to assist with obtaining imaging. While reviewing medications with his daughter, it was noted that sixty memantine pills were missing from the bottle. Poison control was contacted and they confirmed association of these features with memantine. With supportive care, his symptoms resolved in less than 100 h, consistent with the half-life of memantine. Notably, our patient was started on Memantine one month prior to this presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive urgency and echolalia were the most striking symptoms of our patient's presentation. Though hypertension is a known sign of memantine overdose, it can easily be contributed to medication non-compliance in patients with dementia, being treated for hypertension. According to our literature review, this the first case of memantine overdose presenting with echolalia, a sign that is not commonly associated with adverse reactions to medications. This highlights the importance of an early medication review, especially with caregivers of people with dementia.",2024 Feb 1,20240201.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on a memantine overdose.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on a memantine overdose.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of memantine overdose and its adverse effects, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of memantine overdose and its adverse effects, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.",2,95,,

Among the immunotherapy drugs are programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as Nivolumab, which, by blocking this receptor on the surface of T lymphocytes, enhance the immune response. Despite their significant benefits, these agents present specific adverse effects on healthy tissues that need to be understood. One of these effects is immune-mediated colitis, a potentially serious gastrointestinal disorder that may require the permanent discontinuation of the drug. Although it can occur with various immunotherapy regimens, it occurs more frequently with anti-CTLA4 agents like Ipilimumab, with its incidence much lower with anti-PD1 agents. We present the case of a 62-year-old male diagnosed with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma treated with radical nephrectomy and subsequent palliative systemic treatment with Nivolumab. After the third cycle of immunotherapy, he developed abdominal pain and diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed continuous mucosal inflammation up to the cecum, erosions, exudates, and loss of the vascular pattern.

The underlying mechanisms, potential predisposing factors, clinical characteristics, and optimal management strategies for dupilumab-induced EP remain unclear. We report a 71-year-old patient who developed acute EP after the first 600-mg dose of dupilumab. Eosinophils (EOSs) were also transiently increased (up to 1,600 cells/mul). After the acute EP was effectively treated with glucocorticoids, dupilumab treatment was continued. Rash, itching, and immunoglobulin E levels continued to decrease in the patient, and no further pulmonary adverse events occurred. We combined this case with a literature review of nine articles and analyzed data from 93 cases reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of patients developing EP after dupilumab use. Our findings imply that dupilumab may induce EP, particularly in individuals over 45 years old, those with a history of respiratory diseases, and those who have previously used inhaled or systemic steroids. Vigilance is required, especially when there is a persistent elevation in peripheral blood EOSs during treatment. Although steroid treatment can effectively manage EP, more data are needed to determine the safety of resuming dupilumab treatment after controlling pneumonia.",2023,20240108.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses eosinophilic pneumonia as an adverse effect of dupilumab, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses eosinophilic pneumonia as an adverse effect of dupilumab, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,
38251700,,Quetiapine and Valproic Acid-induced Central Hypothyroidism in a Patient with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intractable Epilepsy: A Case Report.,Daramjav N||Takagi J||Iwayama H||Kanemoto K||Otake K,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are prone to disruptive behaviors and aggression. A typical antipsychotics are used to treat these difficult ASD conditions. Several psychotropic drugs have been linked to hypothyroidism. The clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism is indistinguishable from that of an antipsychotic's general adverse effect, which can lead to a delayed or missed diagnosis. Conversely, thyroid dysfunction can exhibit an impact on mood, anxiety, depression, and cognitive functions. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of central hypothyroidism caused by long-term use of valproic acid (VPA) and adding quetiapine to risperidone. The current case had a history of hyperprolactinemia and subclinical hypothyroidism caused by risperidone and VPA, respectively, before the administration of quetiapine. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of quetiapine-induced central hypothyroidism in a patient with ASD, as determined by a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) loading test. TRH loading test may be useful in elucidating the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism in patients receiving quetiapine and VPA.

The disease is often diagnosed late, metastases being present in approximately two-thirds of patients at the time of initial diagnosis. Solitary metastasis of ARMM to a distant organ is exceedingly rare. A 76-year-old woman with a history of laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection of an ARMM 13 months previously, was found to have a solitary liver metastasis in the follow-up computed tomography. A preoperative work-up showed no other distant metastases nor contraindication to surgery. It was therefore considered that resection was indicated. The metachronous solitary liver metastasis from an ARMM was treated by laparoscopic wedge hepatectomy of the eighth segment 18 months after excision of her primary ARMM. Adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab was initiated and continued at 6-week intervals. The patient has not exhibited any immune related Adverse Effects (irAE) during or subsequent to treatment with pembrolizmab and has now completed 12 months of adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy, having survived 33 months from the initial operation for primary ARMM, and remaining recurrence-free 14 months after hepatectomy.

Summary: Valacyclovir is a medication used to treat herpes zoster infection, commonly known as shingles. Valacyclovir is renally cleared and can accumulate in patients with renal dysfunction leading to severe side effects due to the prolonged half-life. VAN is a common adverse effect in patients with underlying kidney disease, that can be easily prevented if valacyclovir is properly dosed. This case series details the clinical outcomes of two elderly patients who were prescribed valacyclovir at six-times the recommended dose based on their renal function. Failure to reduce the dose of valacyclovir resulted in severe neurological and physical manifestations that required hospital admission and emergent hemodialysis. Conclusion: This case series details the importance of adjusting valacyclovir dose based on renal function. In patients with ESRD, the half-life of valacyclovir can be up to 14 hours, therefore hemodialysis should be utilized in severe cases of neurotoxicity to improve rapid excretion of the drug and promote rapid recovery from VAN.",2024 Feb,20220913.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses neurotoxicity associated with valacyclovir in patients with end-stage renal disease, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses neurotoxicity associated with valacyclovir in patients with end-stage renal disease, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

The complete omission of CM administration accompanied by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance may offer an appropriate revascularization treatment. METHODS: We hereby present a case series of four patients with challenging coronary lesions and relative/absolute contraindications to CM use [(hypersensitivity reaction owning to CM, history of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, solitary kidney, or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD)] who underwent absolute zero-contrast IVUS-guided PCI following a predetermined protocol. RESULTS: The initial diagnostic angiography was reviewed for landmark identification, and multiple guidewires created a metallic road map providing additional landmarks and protected side branches. IVUS imaging was performed to determine lesion length, reference segments and landing zones, assess stent expansion/apposition and identify major complications. All procedures were successfully completed without any CM administration, renal function deterioration, pericardial effusion, or stent edge dissection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of absolute zero-contrast IVUS-guided PCI in patients with complex coronary lesions susceptible to CM-associated adverse effects. Since the safety of this strategy is well-documented in patients with CKD and challenging lesions morphology even in acute settings, evidence-based validation of this approach is capable of changing the otherwise conservative treatment of vulnerable patients where even minimum doses of CM may have detrimental effects. SUMMARY FOR THE ANNOTATED TABLE OF CONTENTS: Patients with vulnerable renal function as well as former hypersensitivity reaction to contrast media encounter a significant treatment burden regarding coronary artery disease.

There is growing interest in the potential benefits of combining two biologics to treat patients with poorly controlled conditions. We present a case of a 54-year-old female patient affected with a relapsing-refractory ANCA myeloperoxidase positive eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), presenting with difficult-to-treat asthma and rhino-sinusitis manifestations. She failed several biologics, including omalizumab 300 mg, mepolizumab 100 mg, and benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks. A switch to dupilumab led to significant eosinophilia (7.69 x 10(9)/L) as well as systemic symptoms, and a deterioration of asthma control. Therefore, a combination of dupilumab-benralizumab was started, leading to better nasal and ear outcomes, asthma control and decrease in blood eosinophils. During the 12-month treatment, no adverse effects were observed. We conducted an extensive literature search in MEDLINE for original articles published until August 1st, 2023 reporting the combination of anti-type 2 biologics. A total of 51 cases were retrieved from the literature. Omalizumab was the most frequently combined drugs (34 cases). Combination therapy led to reduction of asthma exacerbations and glucocorticoid intake, though was ineffective only for one EGPA patient. Only one patient on omalizumab-mepolizumab therapy reported a mild adverse reaction. Combination biologic therapies for conditions which share pathogenic pathways appears to be both safe and effective. This approach may benefit patients with uncontrolled conditions and counter side effects of biologics, like dupilumab-related hypereosinophilia.",2024 Mar,20231213.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the combination of monoclonal antibodies for treating eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and asthma, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the combination of monoclonal antibodies for treating eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and asthma, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,
38077387,PMC10703372,A case report of anti-GAD65 antibody-positive autoimmune encephalitis in children associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type-II and literature review.,Sapana T||Li W||Tian F||Yan W||Dou B||Hua S||Zhuo Z,"BACKGROUND: Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are associated with various neurologic conditions described in patients, including stiff person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, refractory epilepsy, and limbic and extra limbic encephalitis. While there are few case reports and research on anti-GAD65 antibody-associated encephalitis in adults, such cases are extremely rare in pediatric cases. METHODS: For the first time, we report a case of anti-GAD65-positive autoimmune encephalitis associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) type II. We reviewed previously published pediatric cases of anti-GAD65 autoimmune encephalitis to discuss their clinical features, laboratory tests, imaging findings, EEG patterns, and prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old, male child presented to the outpatient department after experiencing generalized convulsions for twenty days. The child was admitted for epilepsy and had received oral sodium valproate (500 mg/day) in another center, where investigations such as USG abdomen and MRI brain revealed no abnormalities, however, had abnormal EEG with diffuse mixed activity in the left anterior middle prefrontal temporal region. On the follow-up day, a repeat blood test showed a very low serum drug concentration of sodium valproate hence the dose was increased to 750 mg/day. Then, the child experienced adverse effects including increased sleep, thirst, and poor appetite, prompting the parents to discontinue the medication. A repeat MRI showed increased signals on FLAIR sequences in the right hippocampus hence admitted for further management. The child's past history included a diagnosis of hypothyroidism at the age of 4, and receiving levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily. His parents are healthy with no history of any similar neurological, autoimmune, or genetic diseases, but his uncle had a history of epilepsy. At presentation, he had uncontrolled blood glucose levels with elevated HbA1c levels. Additionally, the serum and CSF autoantibodies were positive against the anti-GAD65 antibody with the titer of 1:100 and 1:32 respectively. The patient was managed with a mixed type of insulin regimen and received first-line immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG) for five consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone and sodium valproate as an antiepileptic drug. Upon achieving a favorable clinical outcome, the patient was discharged with oral medications. RESULTS: Among the 15 pediatric patients reported in this literature, nine presented with limbic encephalitis (LE), three with extralimbic encephalitis (ELE), and three with a combination of limbic and extralimbic encephalitis. Most of these cases exhibited T2-W FLAIR hyperintensities primarily localized to the temporal lobes in the early phase, progressing to hippocampal sclerosis/atrophy in the later phase on MRI. EEG commonly showed slow or spike waves on frontotemporal lobes with epileptic discharges. Prognostic factors varied among patients, with some experiencing persistent refractory seizures, type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), persistent memory impairment, persistent disability requiring full assistance, and, in severe cases, death. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that anti-GAD65 antibody-positive autoimmune encephalitis patients may concurrently present with other APS. Our unique case presented with multiple endocrine syndromes and represents the first reported occurrence in children. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of immunotherapy are crucial for improving clinical symptoms and reducing the likelihood of relapses or permanent disabilities. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment implementation to achieve better patient outcomes.",2023,20231122.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on autoimmune encephalitis in children, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on autoimmune encephalitis in children, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti-GAD65 antibodies and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti-GAD65 antibodies and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

The patient had a history of atopic diseases, with being AD active from infancy. On clinical examination, generalized erythematous skin lesions causing acute pruritus and accompanied by severe skin exfoliation and dryness were present. On closer examination, the patient had a collection of signs and symptoms characterizing Cushing syndrome that included a round and full face (''moon face''), supraclavicular fat pads, and proximal muscle atrophy. The patient stated that AD had exacerbated six years earlier. He had received systemic treatment consisting of methotrexate followed by cyclosporine in another medical facility. However, both medications had proven ineffective and caused malaise. Only oral glucocorticosteroids had proven successful. The patient had been satisfied with the quick and observable effects, and, as he stated, he refrained from regular dermatological visits for six years. During that time, he consistently took 4 mg of methylprednisolone twice daily. Laboratory tests showed undetectably low levels of cortisol, triacylglycerols (TAG) at 288 mg/dL, and total cholesterol levels (CHC) of 81 mg/dL. Based on laboratory findings, clinical presentation, and histopathological evaluation of the skin biopsy, the diagnoses were secondary adrenal insufficiency caused by oral glucocorticosteroid abuse and AD in the form of erythroderma. The endocrinologist suggested a progressive reduction of the dose of methylprednisolone, starting at 2 mg twice daily. Total and sudden drug withdrawal was unacceptable, as it could cause an adrenal crisis. Methylprednisolone was eventually discontinued after being administered for 5 months while the blood levels of ACTH, cortisol, ionized sodium, and ionized potassium were monitored every 4 weeks. 25 mg of hydroxycortisol in divided doses was the actual treatment for adrenal insufficiency, with plans to also gradually reduce the dose. Since the commencement of endocrinological treatment, the dose was reduced to 15 mg after 5 months and to 10 mg after 7 months. Following an 8-month period, the patient began taking 10 mg as needed, usually a few times each month. Calcium carbonate in a dose of 1000 mg taken once daily before a meal for 5 months and vitamin D3 protected the patient from osteoporosis, another manifestation of Cushing syndrome. An initial dose of 4000 IU was prescribed. It is vital to emphasize that all dose adjustments in the endocrinological treatment of Cushing syndrome were a direct consequence of laboratory testing that was performed. In terms of erythrodermic AD management, the patient was treated with cyclosporin, which was once again ineffective. The patient was then prepared for the introduction of dupilumab. A 300 mg dose of the medication was subcutaneously administered every 2 weeks for over a year with positive outcomes, with an initial dose of 600 mg. The patient developed gynecomastia at the beginning of the treatment, initially categorized as another manifestation of Cushing syndrome. However, due to its unilateral nature, it was later identified a benign adverse event of dupilumab, as described in the literature (1). Due to a decline in effectiveness, the treatment was recently switched from dupilumab to baricitinib, with positive outcomes. Erythroderma, which the patient presented in our case, is an acute condition characterized by erythema and scaling that involves more than 90% of the skin's surface area (2,3). It can be potentially fatal due to electrolyte imbalance, fluid loss from capillary dilation, and significant heat dissipation (3). According to estimates, erythroderma is relatively rare, affecting approximately 1-2 patients for every 100,000 people per year, with AD comprising 8.7% of all cases of erythroderma (2,4). Despite growing therapeutic possibilities for AD, corticosteroids remain the drug of choice in severe exacerbations, including erythroderma, when we cannot afford to wait for the effects of therapy. Oral glucocorticosteroids can be an effective treatment for acute flares of AD (5). However, there is a lack of evidence for the long-term efficacy and safety of oral glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of AD (5). Reported side-effects include endocrine disturbances, gastric ulcers, cardiovascular disorders (arterial hypertension, atherosclerotic disease), osteoporosis, glaucoma, cataracts, and an increased risk of infections. Corticosteroids also have an undesired action on the skin that can result in steroid acne, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, hypertrichosis, and impaired wound healing. The psychological adverse effects of steroid treatment can be quite severe and include depression and psychosis (6), The therapy should only be applied in the short-term, not exceeding one week, due to the occurrence of the abovementioned side-effects, which presented in as Cushing syndrome our patient (5). However, glucocorticoids are one of the most commonly used drugs in clinical dermatology practice, raising concerns about the risk of their misuse, which can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency, among other complications (7). When no other treatment options are available, it should be noted that many of the side-effects of oral glucocorticosteroids can be mitigated through close monitoring and the implementation of appropriate preventive measures (7).",2023 Nov,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of erythrodermic atopic dermatitis and its treatment.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of erythrodermic atopic dermatitis and its treatment.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of erythrodermic atopic dermatitis and the complications arising from glucocorticosteroid abuse, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of erythrodermic atopic dermatitis and the complications arising from glucocorticosteroid abuse, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

ICIs are associated with immune-related adverse events including autoimmune encephalitis, although both paraneoplastic phenomena and ICI treatment may lead to autoimmunity. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 72-year old male patient with small-cell lung cancer, who during adjuvant treatment with Durvalumab developed GABA(B)R(1) and GAD65 antibodies and both diabetes and autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Because he was followed prospectively as part of a treatment study, we had access to repeated serum samples and cognitive assessments over time prior to developing encephalitis and diabetes, in addition to later assessments. A high titer of GABA(B)R(1) antibodies appeared early, while GAD65 antibodies appeared later with a lower titer in parallel with the development of diabetes. As he subsequently developed clinical signs of encephalitis, verified by EEG and brain MRI, he also had CSF GABA(B)R(1) antibodies. Durvalumab was discontinued and steroid treatment with subsequent plasmapheresis were started, resulting in reduction of both CSF and serum antibody levels. Clinical signs of encephalitis gradually improved. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of being aware of possible serious autoimmune adverse reactions, including neurological syndromes such as encephalitis, when treating patients with high risk of para-neoplasia with ICIs. In addition, the case shows the development of autoantibodies over time.",2023,20231016.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses autoimmune encephalitis as a complication following treatment with durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, rather than complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses autoimmune encephalitis as a complication following treatment with durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, rather than complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) and atypical femoral fractures (AFF) are both rare but serious adverse effects of anti-resorptive drugs (ARD) such as bisphosphonates. The most advanced form of MRONJ is termed stage 3 and can lead to severe local sequelae like pathologic mandibular fractures (PMF). This study reports a case of MRONJ-related PMF and AFF with osteomyelitis secondary to bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis. CASE REPORT A 63-year-old white woman was diagnosed with PMF related to MRONJ stage 3 during treatment of an AFF with osteomyelitis. She had been treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis with 70 mg of alendronate weekly for 2 years. The PMF was treated by stable internal fixation combined with debridement and sequestrectomy, but further debridement was required and 2 mandibular implants were then removed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the mandibular infection was controlled after the second surgery. Three weeks later, she was discharged from the hospital, instructed to discontinue the use of alendronate, and referred for 30 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At the 3-year follow-up, the PMF was completely healed without signs of mandibular infection or bone exposure. CONCLUSIONS This report raises awareness of both MRONJ and AFF as possible adverse effects of short-term bisphosphonate therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, and highlights the importance of dental and orthopedic follow-ups.

The most common reported adverse effects are hypokaliemia and hypernatremia. We describe a case of agranulocytosis, a rarely described side effect that may be fatal. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45 year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit for post-surgical meningitis following meningioma resection. Meropenem and vancomycin were first introduced. A DRESS-syndrom with meropenem was suspected. Neutropenia was diagnosed three days after the introduction of parenteral fosfomycin and agranulocytosis four days later. Eosinophilia was also observed. A bone marrow aspiration was performed showing a disappearance of the neutrophil granulocyte line and a significant eosinophilia. Meropenem was discontinued. Fosfomycin was maintained and filgrastim was added. As filgrastim had no effect, the relationship with fosfomycin was suspected, so it was then withheld. An increase of the neutrophil count was observed. Because of the complexity of the case, the unfavorable course of the illness and the urgent need for revision surgery, a rechallenge with fosfomycin was done followed by a decrease of the neutrophil count. CONCLUSION: This is the third paper reporting agranulocytosis induced by fosfomycin, and the first detailed description of a case. Based on chronological and semiological criteria and bibliographic data, the event was qualified as probable with the Naranjo adverse drug probability scale. Literature data is scarce. The summary of product characteristics mentions that only a few cases of transient neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported. An analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Database highlighted a higher than expected frequency of agranulocytosis in patients treated with fosfomycin. Parenteral fosfomycin is often used in patients receiving other medications, so that it is rarely the only suspect. In our case, the results of the bone marrow aspiration, the sudden drop of the neutrophil count with concomitant eosinophilia and the absence of improvement despite the dose decrease, point towards an immuno-allergic mechanism. However, the overlap between the suspected DRESS induced by meropenem and the agranulocytosis do not allow to conclude with certainty on the causality. Awareness should be raised about this side effect.",2023 Oct 13,20231013.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on fosfomycin-induced agranulocytosis, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on fosfomycin-induced agranulocytosis, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses agranulocytosis as an adverse effect of fosfomycin, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses agranulocytosis as an adverse effect of fosfomycin, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Nowadays, focal radiofrequency ablation is a valid technique for BE treatment by inducing a superficial and focal thermic destruction of metaplastic tissues. According to the literature, the most frequent patient-related adverse events of this procedure are esophageal iatrogenic stenosis, mucosal laceration or perforation of the esophagus, chest pain, and odynophagia/dysphagia. Postoperative heart rhythm abnormalities have been reported very rarely. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old patient with HE was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with the Barrx catheter system. He had 2 symptomatic episodes of atrial flutter in the immediate postoperative period requiring an external electrical cardioversion to induce a return to sinus cardiac rhythm. After atrial flutter ablation, 2 more radiofrequency procedures were performed, without adverse events. A laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was carried out with complete endoscopic and histologic eradication of BE after 12-month follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of atrial flutter after esophageal RFA. Different mechanisms acting on an anatomic predisposing substrate can potentially play a role in starting atrial flutter, and include inflammation, autonomic activation, and myocardial injury. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of this new type of adverse effect could potentially modify indications and postoperative monitoring of RFA treatment for BE. Endoscopists should know the possibility of this procedural complication in high-risk patients and they should propose alternative techniques or implement close cardiac monitoring in the postoperative period.",2023 Oct 5,20231005.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': ""The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of atrial flutter after radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's esophagus."", 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of atrial flutter after radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's esophagus.,2,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article discusses complications related to radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's esophagus, specifically atrial flutter, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations."", 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's esophagus, specifically atrial flutter, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

Historically, the conventional treatments for PPC have been linked to a grim prognosis. However, with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including PD-1 inhibitors, for the management of NSCLC, our center has witnessed encouraging outcomes in two PPC patients who underwent PD-1 inhibitor therapy. The first patient was a 70-year-old male who initially came to our attention after the discovery of a lung mass during a routine physical examination. A lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PPC, and further complications included brain metastasis. Surgical intervention was conducted for the brain metastases, while PD-1 inhibitor therapy was employed for the lung tumors. The second patient was a 60-year-old male who was admitted with a history of persistent coughing and hemoptysis, which led to the diagnosis of a left lung tumor. Subsequent postoperative pathology revealed pulmonary adenocarcinoma coexisting with PPC. However, 2 months later, distant metastases were detected during a follow-up examination. The patient encountered difficulty in tolerating the adverse effects of chemotherapy, prompting the initiation of PD-1 inhibitor treatment. Notably, both patients underwent one cycle of PD-1 inhibitor therapy without encountering significant adverse reactions, and their responses proved to be promising during re-examinations.

Although adrenal hemorrhage due to DOACs has previously been reported, this is a rare condition that can present as an emergency. In this case report, we present a 65-year-old man who recently had bilateral knee arthroplasty and was started on rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis following the surgery. CASE REPORT Ten days after bilateral knee arthroplasty and starting rivaroxaban, the patient presented to the Emergency Department with severe, sudden abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography detected significantly enlarged bilateral adrenals, with ill-defined heterogeneous density extending to the upper part of perinephric and paranephric spaces, suggesting bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. A cosyntropin stimulation test was used to confirm the suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol levels were 66 nmol/L before stimulation and 83 nmol/L 60 min after cosyntropin administration. Hydrocortisone was started intravenously at a dose of 50 mg every 8 h. After his symptoms improved, he was discharged on oral hydrocortisone at 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the evening. Seven weeks after discharge, follow-up abdominal ultrasonography showed that the bilateral adrenal hemorrhage had resolved.

37643053,,CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULAR MEMBRANES ASSOCIATED WITH PAPILLITIS IN A PATIENT ON CHECKPOINT INHIBITOR.,Xia T||Bracha P||Bhatt N||Aleman T||Brucker A,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe a case of bilateral peripapillary choroidal neovascular membranes in the setting of a patient with papillitis associated with pembrolizumab for Stage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung. METHODS: This was a retrospective case report with fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography. RESULTS: A 59-year-old woman with Stage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung on pembrolizumab therapy presented with symptoms of blurry vision. She was found to have bilateral papillitis with right eye peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage and serous retinal detachment involving the fovea. Fluorescein angiography suggested peripapillary neovascularization with leakage in both eyes. Intravitreal bevacizumab injections were given in both eyes on a monthly basis with dramatic resolution of subretinal hemorrhage and fluid and control of peripapillary choroidal neovascular membranes. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab has been associated with many ocular adverse effects, and to the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of pembrolizumab associated with papillitis and peripapillary choroidal neovascular membranes.

METHODS: Retrospective case report with fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: A 55-year old patient with metastatic melanoma presented with a complaint of gradually worsening blurry vision in the right eye during treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib, three months after discontinuation of nivolumab. Based on the clinical examination, optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography findings, and a thorough laboratory work-up, he was diagnosed with a bilateral VKH-like uveitis without extraocular manifestations. The uveitis responded well to oral corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like uveitis is a rare adverse effect of MAPK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Similar pathogenetic mechanisms including a drug-induced autoimmunity targeted against benign and malignant melanocytes may underlie MAPK inhibitor-induced and immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced VKH-like uveitis. In our report, the patient developed a VKH-like uveitis during MAPK inhibition therapy, four months after discontinuation of nivolumab. It is difficult to delineate whether MAPK inhibition alone was responsible for this adverse effect, or whether, on the contrary, potentiation occurred as a result of immune modulation by previous treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Further cases are needed to further clarify this latter hypothesis.",2023 Sep 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

METHODS: A 19-year-old female patient presented to Lenox Hill Hospital following thalamic GBM recurrence. She subsequently underwent two infusions of intra-arterial BEV (NCT01269853) and experienced a period of relative disease stability until progression in 2022. One month later, MRI disclosed diffuse enhancement representative of LMS of GBM. The patient subsequently underwent five cycles of IT BEV in mid-2022 (IND 162119). Doses of 25 mg, 37.5 mg, 50 mg, 50 mg, and 37.8 mg were delivered at two-week intervals between doses 1-4. The final 37.8 mg dose was given one day following her fourth dose, given that the patient was to be discharged, traveled several hours to our center, and was tolerating therapy well. Dosage was decreased due to the short interval between the final two treatments. Shortly after IT BEV completion, she received a third dose of IA BEV. RESULTS: Our patient did not show any signs of serious adverse effects or dose limiting toxicities following any of the treatments. It is difficult to determine PFS due to the rapid progression associated with LMS of GBM and rapid timeframe of treatment.

37545116,PMC10421751,Pseudo-Progression of Melanoma Treated with Nivolumab/Ipilimumab: A Case Report.,Cuevas Velazquez AM||Ng WL||Calderon Martinez EJ||Yeruva SLH,"BACKGROUND Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that can be difficult to manage. Its treatment has been transformed by immunotherapy. Melanoma cells frequently have mutations that make them vulnerable to attack by the immune system, and this is how immunotherapy can fight this cancer. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors targets mechanisms that malignant cells use to evade immune system detection, blocking proteins produced by the tumor, and allowing the immune system to identify and attack cancerous cells. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman presented with a lump on the right side of her chest. Tests revealed a metastatic malignant tumor with melanocytic differentiation. Stage IV melanoma was diagnosed, and the patient started therapy with nivolumab/ipilimumab for palliative intent, which she tolerated without adverse effects. However, she was hospitalized for Clostridioides difficile colitis after 3 treatment cycles, and computed tomography (CT) scan findings suggested disease progression. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT obtained after her discharge from the hospital showed a complete metabolic response at all disease sites, indicating the initial progression was most likely a pseudo-progression from the use of immunotherapy. The patient continued with nivolumab as a single agent and has been doing well. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of careful evaluation of immunotherapy response in patients with melanoma. The initial progression noted in this patient was most likely pseudo-progression, which resolved with further immunotherapy. Clinicians should consider PET-CT imaging in cases of suspected pseudo-progression to avoid unnecessary changes in therapy. Patient response to immunotherapy demonstrates the effectiveness of immunotherapy in treating advanced melanoma.",2023 Aug 7,20230807.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of melanoma treated with immunotherapy and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of melanoma treated with immunotherapy and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
37459498,,High-dose armodafinil in treatment-refractory bipolar depression.,Kwok WY||Stephens V||Nasrallah HA,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar depression is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder associated with a high risk of morbidity and suicidality. Standard antidepressants approved for treating major depressive disorder fail to exert efficacy in bipolar depression. Although 5 agents have been developed for the treatment of bipolar depression, treatment resistance is still observed in some patients, and requires off-label pharmacotherapy. Modafinil and armodafinil have been reported to improve treatment-resistant bipolar depression, but with inconsistent results. METHODS: We present a case of a 65-year-old woman with severe bipolar depression who failed to respond to electroconvulsive therapy and IV ketamine but later responded to high-dose armodafanil. RESULTS: The patient responded to high-dose armodafinil (gradually titrated to 1,000 mg/d) and achieved remission with good tolerability for 5 years. Recently, she contracted COVID-19 and developed muscular weakness. After a lengthy workup, we became concerned for myopathy as an adverse effect from armodafinil. The patient's dose of armodafinil was significantly reduced and she subsequently became very depressed and functionally disabled before improving again when armodafinil 1,000 mg/d was reinstated. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that some of the negative results seen in research of armodafinil for bipolar depression may be due to the use of low doses (100 to 200 mg/d), and higher doses may be needed for adequate response in treatment-resistant bipolar depression.",2023 Aug,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The abstract does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of bipolar depression with armodafinil and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the treatment of bipolar depression with armodafinil and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old Hispanic woman with a medical history of resistant hypertension treated with hydralazine 10 mg twice daily for 1 year presented with generalized weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and gross hematuria. There was fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and anemia. Chest computed tomography and bronchoscopy revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Serologic testing was positive for anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Smith, lupus anticoagulant, anti-histone, anti-cardiolipin IgM antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3). A kidney biopsy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis with an overlapping finding of membranous nephropathy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and plasmapheresis were initiated. The patient survived but required continuous hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although a few cases of simultaneous antibody-associated vasculitis and drug-induced lupus nephritis secondary to hydralazine use have been reported, this case is singular. Similar findings were previously reported with doses of 50-100 mg two to three times daily over 1-5 years.

This population also has an increasing prevalence of dementia in the successive seventh, eighth and nineth decade of life, and dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by pathologic alpha-synucleins, proteins that take part in neuronal DNA damage repair. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 77-year-old man, with a history of coronary artery disease and mild cognitive impairment, who experienced subacute behavioral changes over 3 months with wording-finding difficulty, memory loss, confusion, perseveration, and irritable mood. Neuroimaging studies disclosed a 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.7 cm cystic enhancing mass with central necrosis in the left temporal lobe of the brain. Gross total resection of the tumor revealed IDH-1 wild-type glioblastoma. After treatment with radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy, his cognitive status deteriorated rapidly, and he died from unexpected sudden death 2 months after radiation. Autopsy of his brain revealed (i) tumor cells with atypical nuclei and small lymphocytes, (ii) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and Lewy bodies that were positive for alpha-synuclein in the midbrain, pons, amygdala, putamen and globus pallidus, and (iii) no amyloid plaques and only rare neurofibrillary tangles near the hippocampi. CONCLUSIONS: This patient most likely had pre-clinical limbic subtype of dementia with Lewy bodies prior to his diagnosis of glioblastoma. The radiation and temozolomide that was used to treat his tumor may have accelerated neuronal damage due to induction of DNA breakage when his brain was already compromised by pathologic alpha-synucleins. alpha-Synucleinopathy could be a negative outcome modifier in glioblastoma patients.",2023 Jul 4,20230704.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case report related to glioblastoma and dementia with Lewy bodies, focusing on the effects of radiation and chemotherapy, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case report related to glioblastoma and dementia with Lewy bodies, focusing on the effects of radiation and chemotherapy, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

37291648,PMC10251649,Atrial fibrillation induced by gabapentin: a case report.,Park SH||Hunter K||Berry H||Martins YC,"BACKGROUND: Gabapentin is commonly prescribed for the treatment of neuropathic pain, restless leg syndrome, and partial-onset seizures. Although the most frequent side effects of gabapentin are associated with the central nervous system, gabapentin can also affect the cardiovascular system. Case reports and observational studies have showed that gabapentin can be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation. However, all the evidence is concentrated in patients older than 65 years old with comorbidities that predispose them to the development of arrhythmias. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of an African American male in his 20s that presented to our chronic pain clinic with lumbar radiculitis and developed atrial fibrillation 4 days after being started on gabapentin. Laboratory workup did not show significant abnormalities, including normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, toxicology screen, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunt. The patient was initially treated with diltiazem for heart rate control and apixaban. Direct current cardioversion with successful conversion to sinus rhythm was performed 24 hours after admission. The patient was then discharged on apixaban and diltiazem. Apixaban was changed to low-dose aspirin 1 month after discharge.

Whereas programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have shown promising response in advanced esophageal cancer, they have not been used in the perioperative treatment of resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer. Whether immunotherapy can be incorporated into neoadjuvant therapy has became a challenging question for researchers. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 65-year-old male who had a history of progressive dysphagia for approximately 1 month. He underwent pertinent studies including computed tomography (CT)，gastroscopy，and pathological biopsy resulting in a diagnosis of medium-low differentiated squamous carcinoma of the thoracic segment of the esophagus (cT2N2M0 stage III). After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, gastroscopy showed the lesion in the esophagus was no longer present. Subsequently, the patient received thoracoscopic radical resection of esophageal cancer and achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) in postoperative pathological evaluation. During the whole treatment, no adverse effect was recorded and to date no evidence of recurrence has been recorded. CONCLUSION: Our report suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy not only improve the R0 resection and pCR rate in patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer, but also the adverse effects are within the control range. However, the selection of therapeutic strategy, predictors of response to treatment, and interval time between neoadjuvant treatment and surgery still await more reliable evidence-based studies with large prospective samples.",2022 Aug 26,20220826.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case study on neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy for esophageal cancer, which does not relate to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case study on neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy for esophageal cancer, which does not relate to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

The most commonly observed adverse effects associated with nelarabine are mainly hematological, i.e. neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, neurological, and gastrointestinal toxicities have been reported. Central nervous system neurotoxicity associated with nelarabine is very rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old man patient diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia had experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizure which lasted for a few seconds and upper extremity weakness after three weeks of the nelarabine infusion. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have shown periventricular and nucleus caudatus abnormalities. Radiological findings suggested toxic leukoencephalopathy and acute infarct of right nucleus caudatus. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: After high-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and support treatment, his neurologic symptoms disappeared except for mild peroral numbness. However, radiological sequelae persisted despite clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Physicians involved in the care of these patients who use nelarabine should be aware of the fact that cerebral toxicity of the nelarabine may occur especially in the presence of predisposing factors.

Neutropenia is a rare but serious adverse effect of clopidogrel. It is unknown whether this adverse effect has any association with impaired kidney function. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old male with chronic kidney disease was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. During hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with contrast-induced nephropathy, treated symptomatically, and discharged with a back-to-baseline creatinine level. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the emergency department with fever and chills. Complete blood count showed leukopenia (0.84 x 10(3)/mm(3)) and severe neutropenia (0.13 x 10(3)/mm(3)). Blood cultures were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clopidogrel was stopped immediately and switched into ticagrelor. Imipenem and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were administered to the patient. The patient's white blood cell and absolute neutrophil count were within the normal range after four days of treatment. The patient was discharged after a 10-day hospitalization, and his complete blood counts were normal during further follow-ups.

The high transmission and seriousness of COVID-19 necessitated the development of an effective vaccine to control spread of the disease. Multiple vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, namely, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna (mRNA), and the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (vector) vaccines. As these novel vaccines have been used, adverse effects have been reported, ranging from mild myalgia to severe anaphylaxis and thrombotic events. Thrombotic consequences raised suspicion for the development of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which is a severe condition associated with occlusion of venous sinuses and disruption of the venous system flow. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old healthy woman presented with a 2-week history of persistent and progressive headache 4 days after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). Cerebral computed tomography (CT) and CT venography confirmed the presence of extensive thrombus involving the left transverse and sigmoid sinus as well as the internal jugular vein. Furthermore, other than recent the COVID-19 vaccination, there were no precipitant risk factors in her clinical history or in the detailed laboratory work-up. CONCLUSIONS Headache associated with red flags following administration of any COVID-19 vaccine should prompt urgent neuroimaging to rule out secondary causes and determine the appropriate management.

Aside from its therapeutic benefits, cannabis exhibits many adverse effects. Psychosis is one of the potentially harmful effects of cannabis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Thai man, who reported cannabis use for 2 years and discontinued for 3 months, restarted smoking two bongs (2 g equivalence) of cannabis. Two hours later, he had a penile erection, felt a severe persistent sharp pain in his penis, and reported that his glans looked distorted. Intending to eradicate the pain, he decided to trim the penile skin several times and completely amputated his penis himself using scissors. Cannabis-induced psychosis was diagnosed because symptoms began after cannabis use, without evidence of other substance abuse. To confirm the cannabis exposure, his urine immunoassay was positive for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC). The distal penis was deemed too dirty and fragile for reconstruction. Bleeding was controlled, penile stump irrigated and debrided, and scrotal urethrostomy was performed by a urologist. After admission and cannabis discontinuation, his delusion and hallucination subsided. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis-induced psychosis is an adverse effect of cannabis, which may lead to impaired judgement unexpected self-harm.

Vaccination of the general population has resulted in the administration of more than 6,700,000,000 doses by the end of October 2021, which is the most effective method to prevent hospitalization and death. Among the adverse effects described, myocarditis and pericarditis are low-frequency events (less than 10 per 100,000 people), mainly observed with messenger RNA vaccines. The mechanisms responsible for these effects have not been specified, considering an exacerbated and uncontrolled immune response and an autoimmune response against specific cardiomyocyte proteins.

34958618,,Probable Encephalopathy and Spasticity in a Multiple Sclerosis Patient Following Carbapenem Administration: A Case Report and Brief Literature Review.,Klimko CV||Sanders JM||Johns ML,"Purpose: The purpose of this case report is to describe spasticity and encephalopathy that developed in a multiple sclerosis patient following carbapenem administration. Summary: A 55-year-old female with multiple sclerosis developed spasticity and encephalopathy within 24 hours of meropenem and ertapenem administration. This was the second time that she had developed encephalopathy following carbapenem administration. The patient gradually recovered over four days following discontinuation of carbapenem therapy. Conclusion: Carbapenem neurotoxicity, a well-documented adverse effect, has been linked to several risk factors, including central nervous system lesions. Despite this, there is little evidence describing the risk of neurotoxicity in patients with multiple sclerosis.

34941095,PMC8702249,Acute pancreatitis caused by tigecycline: A case report and literature review.,Wang PF||Zou H||Zhu JH||Shi FE,"RATIONALE: There is evidence that tigecycline has broad-spectrum antibiotic activity against a variety of complicated infections. However, adverse effects are inevitable, including gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; in 2006, acute pancreatitis was also brought into the side-effect list after postmarketing surveillance. Here, we present a case of tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 87-year-old female patient with urinary tract infection received an intravenous drip of tigecycline for 6 days, after which she developed abdominal distension, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal rigidity. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was suspected to have tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis. INTERVENTIONS: Tigecycline was discontinued immediately, and the patient received a series of immediate treatments including an indwelling gastric tube for continuous gastrointestinal decompression and inhibition of gastric acid and pancreatic enzyme secretion. OUTCOMES: Following initial interventions, we observed that the patient's symptoms improved significantly, and abdominal distension, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal rigidity were slightly relieved. After 5 days of follow-up, blood lipase and amylase levels decreased to normal levels. Unfortunately, the patient developed convulsions during the use of multiple antibiotics after 1 week and then died of septic shock and acute liver failure. LESSONS: Acute pancreatitis caused by tigecycline is rare. However, in the application of antibiotics, the possibility of adverse effects must be considered, and antibiotics should be used reasonably. If the patient has relevant symptoms, it is necessary to stop using tigecycline immediately, carry out symptomatic treatment, and change to other types of antibiotics for antibacterial treatment.",2021 Dec 23,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses acute pancreatitis caused by tigecycline, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses acute pancreatitis caused by tigecycline, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

However, long-term administration of metoclopramide is associated with various adverse effects, and its therapeutic effects are short-lasting. Hence, traditional East Asian medicine has received increasing attention as a short-term strategy for treating these symptoms. PATIENT CONCERNS: The present report discusses the cases of a 71-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman diagnosed with cerebellar infarction. Both patients reported nausea and vomiting, which appeared during hospitalization following cerebellar infarction. DIAGNOSES: One patient was diagnosed with a left cerebellar infarction and hemorrhagic transformation, while the other was diagnosed with a bilateral cerebellar infarction. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients took Banhabaekchulcheonma-tang (BT) and Oryeong-san (OS) extracts. OUTCOMES: The patient in Case 1 experienced a rapid decrease in nausea from day 5 of BT and OS administration, and metoclopramide was discontinued on day 7. The patient in Case 2 experienced a clear decrease in the number of vomiting episodes from day 6 of BT and OS administration and did not take metoclopramide thereafter. LESSONS: Other than drugs used to mitigate symptoms, there are no suitable treatments available for nausea and vomiting caused by cerebellar infarction. In the present cases, nausea and vomiting remained unresolved even after 3 weeks of treatment with conventional therapies; however, these symptoms significantly improved after administration of the traditional East Asian herbal medicines BT and OS, and there were no recurrences. These cases demonstrate that traditional herbal medicine can reduce the side effects associated with long-term administration of metoclopramide and help patients resume their daily lifestyle. In addition, BT and OS treatment can facilitate administration of other drugs, highlighting its potential to aid in the treatment of stroke.

Histopathology of the largest scalp lesion revealed a partly desmoplastic cutaneous squamous carcinoma with perineural invasion. Initial imaging revealed metastatic disease in cervical lymph nodes, bones and lungs. The scalp lesions were successfully treated with bleomycin-based electrochemotherapy. Under initial systemic therapy using four cycles of cetuximab, metastatic disease progressed. Following the approval by the health insurance, compassionate use of pembrolizumab monotherapy was initiated. After three cycles of pembrolizumab, however, metastatic disease further progressed and the patient finally died from global respiratory insufficiency.

We analyzed imaging and clinical features from early cases of axillary LAP in six COVID-19 vaccine recipients with a history of breast cancer. METHOD: Among the patients with a history of breast cancer and recent COVID-19 vaccine administration, six patients who showed isolated axillary LAP were gathered. Radiologic features were reviewed from breast ultrasound, chest computed tomography, and breast magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and pathological information were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: The interval between ultrasound detection of LAP and last COVID-19 vaccine administration ranged from 14 to 28 days (mean 21.67 days). Round shape of the lymph node and irregular cortex were noted in 2 and 0 cases, respectively. Mean maximum cortical thickness, length to width ratio and interval aggravation in maximum cortical thickening were 4.2 mm, 1.34, and 2.81-fold with cut-off value of 3 mm, 1.5, 2.0-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: We observed axillary LAP ipsilateral to a recent vaccine administration persisting longer than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced. In our patients, COVID-19 vaccine-related LAP tended to show increased cortical thickness without cortical irregularity. Oncologist as well as radiologist should be familiar with the fact that COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of vaccine type or dosage, can frequently cause ipsilateral axillary LAP, showing some suspicious features more often than others, and can persist longer than anticipated so that both over- and underdiagnosis can be avoided.

To our knowledge, there are minimal reports of temozolomide-induced DRESS syndrome. CASE REPORT: We present a 54-year-old man with glioblastoma multiforme who presented with a fever, diarrhea and progressively worsening rash 6 weeks after starting temozolomide. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: The patient was diagnosed recurrent DRESS syndrome and restarted on a gradual prednisone taper with resolution over the following weeks. Unfortunately, the patient was unable to be followed long-term due to relocation to a different state. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, there are minimal reports of temozolomide-induced DRESS syndrome.

We read with great interest the article of Jacisko et al[2]. In addition, we report rare US images of HO in direct contact with the swollen ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel that was not detected by plain radiography. A 60-year-old female presented with a six-month history of elbow pain. Her pain was located at the medial side of the right elbow joint and accompanied by numbness of the fifth finger. She had a history of excessive manual labor due to her occupation as a gardener over the past few decades. The numbness began with the fifth finger initially and gradually extended toward the medial side of the elbow joint. US images showed hyperechoic masses causing acoustic shadowing, in direct contact with the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel. The HO seems to be related to compression of the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve was swollen (Figure 1-a, b). The maximal cross-sectional-area was 0.10 cm2. Plain elbow radiographs demonstrated osteophyte formation in the coronoid process of the ulna, the coronoid fossa of the humerus, and in the radial head (Figure 1-c). Radiographic imaging showed no heterotopic bone formation in the soft tissues surrounding the medial side of the right elbow. We performed US-guided perineural injection with a mixture of 1 cc of 10 mg triamcinolone and 3 cc of 0.2 % ropivacaine. Her pain and numbness gradually diminished with no adverse effects. Her pain reduced by 70% after two weeks, with pain improvement sustained for 6 months after the injection. Jacisko et al[2]have presented some diagnostic US imaging on neuropathy caused by HO located close to the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel. Especially, this case showed definite heterotopic bone formation in the soft tissue surrounding the medial side of the elbow on plain radiography. The classic sonographic patterns of HO were defined by the presence of central hypoechoic area surrounded by foci of calcification [3, 4]. The distortion of normal soft tissue and the formation of hypoechoic areas, with or without foci of calcification can also be shown as early signs[3, 4]. The use of US for HO is highly sensitive and provides an earlier diagnosis compared with other radiologic modalities [3-5]. It can be an effective treatment strategy and may improve the prognosis of neuropathy. We highlight that US evaluation can provide early diagnostic information about ulnar nerve morphology and various HO formations even if plane radiographs did not show heterotopic bone formation in the soft tissues surrounding the medial side of the elbow.",2021 Nov 25,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Currently, there is no definitive treatment for coronavirus disease 2019. Convalescent plasma therapy has become a potential specific curative method, while vaccines as protection modalities require further work. CASE PRESENTATION: Eight non-intubated Indonesian patients, ages ranging from 40 to 74 years old, with coronavirus disease 2019 confirmed by viral Ribonucleid Acid (RNA) real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included. Four patients were administered two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, and the other four patients were administered one dose of convalescent plasma with an antibody titer of 1:320, within the first 14 days since symptoms occurred. The median times from illness onset to convalescent plasma therapy and from the first day of hospital admission to convalescent plasma therapy were 13 and 6.5 days, respectively. All patients showed improvements in clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, thorax imaging, negative conversion of polymerase chain reaction results, and decreased oxygen supplementation within 1 week after convalescent plasma therapy. Patients with two convalescent plasma doses tended to have faster recovery than those with one convalescent plasma dose. No severe adverse effects were observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: This is the first case series in Indonesia showing that convalescent plasma therapy is safe and well tolerated and that early convalescent plasma therapy before the patient is intubated could potentially prevent disease progression, increase the recovery rate, and shorten the inpatient time of stay.",2021 Nov 23,20211123.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on convalescent plasma therapy, not COVID-19 vaccination, and thus does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on convalescent plasma therapy, not COVID-19 vaccination, and thus does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

We describe a case of an elderly woman on chronic lithium therapy for bipolar affective disorder who initially presented with dehydration from vomiting but possibly developed extra-pontine myelinolysis (EPM) after over-zealous correction of hyponatraemia. Steroids administered appeared to have prevented further progression but a persisting hyperosmolar state then alerted us to the presence of nephrogenic DI.

34672841,,Denosumab-related osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal-benefit of the early surgical management.,Perina V||Salzman R||Treglerova J,"Background: Antiresorptive drugs are widely used to reduce bone mineral loss in patients with osteoporosis and to prevent skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic cancers and multiple myeloma (MM). Both the bisphosphonates (BP) and denosumab typically used in this indication were shown to be effective and relatively safe. Obviously, this medication could have some adverse effects; one of them is osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal. Only sporadic cases of external auditory canal osteonecrosis have been published yet. Here, we provide a case of denosumab-related osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal successfully treated surgically in the early stage of the disease. Case report: A 68-year-old patient with breast cancer underwent comprehensive oncological treatment, including denosumab administration. She was diagnosed with osteonecroses in the jaw and ear canal. The necrotic bones in both regions were resected with primary wound closure. Both affected sites healed well with no signs of necrosis recurrence. Conclusions: Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal is a rare but probably underdiagnosed complication of antiresorptive medication. It has a negative impact on patient quality of life if left untreated. Early surgical treatment appears to be effective.

METHODS: After a brief introduction to the PS, we conduct a detailed description of the case and review, after a search on the PubMed database, the known risk factors, drugs associated with the onset of this syndrome, and the management of PS. RESULTS: Pisa syndrome is a rare type of dystonia first described in 1972 as an adverse effect of neuroleptic agents. Clozapine is known for its small potential for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms, and it is often preferred as an alternative when extrapyramidal symptoms develop over the course of treatment with other agents. Many drugs have been associated with this kind of dystonia; however, we only found 5 previous reports of clozapine-induced PS. Tardive syndromes secondary to antipsychotic medication are better treated with the reduction or interruption of the causative agent, which was effective in this case.

34622869,PMC8500645,Dienogest-induced major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: A case report.,Lee SM||Park JK,"RATIONALE: Dienogest is a type of progestin used for the treatment of endometriosis (EM). However, a significant adverse effect of dienogest is depression; therefore, assessing for a history of mood disorders is recommended before prescribing the drug. Herein, we present the case of a patient with no history of psychiatric disorders who was diagnosed with dienogest-induced major depressive disorder. This case emphasizes the importance of close monitoring for negative mood changes in patients taking dienogest. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 41-year-old woman underwent surgery for EM. Postoperatively, her gynecologist prescribed dienogest (2 mg/d) to control EM symptoms. Two months after the initiation of dienogest, she manifested insomnia almost daily, gradually became depressed, lost interest in all activities, had incessant cries, and repeatedly thought of death. She had no history of major physical or psychiatric disorders. DIAGNOSIS: Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe. INTERVENTIONS: A psychiatric consultation was recommended, an antidepressant was prescribed, and dienogest was discontinued. OUTCOMES: Two weeks later, there was significant improvement in the symptoms, and after 4 weeks, she remained in a stable mood with no suicidal thoughts. She was followed up for 13 months with a maintenance dose of escitalopram (5 -10mg/d), until the psychiatrist recommended treatment discontinuation, with a confirmed state of remission.

In this case report, a low dose of aripiprazole (ARP) successfully improved oral cenesthopathy and then improved ORS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old female patient complained of a sensation of astringent film sticking on her tongue. She was also very anxious about her bad breath at work.We prescribed 0.5 mg of ARP for her symptoms because she worried about potential drowsiness. One week later, the patient reported that the oral sensation had resolved 2 to 3 days after the mediation was administered. No obvious adverse effects were observed except temporary arousal during sleep. Three months after the initial visit, her symptoms worsened, partly because of her job change, so we increased the dose of ARP from 0.5 mg to 1 mg. Later, the patient reported that she was better able to manage the anxiety about her breath. At the 2-year follow-up, her symptoms have continued to improve without medication.

34523298,,Graves' disease with spontaneous resolution following ocrelizumab in primary progressive multiple sclerosis.,Duarte DB||Silva AMD||Freitas C||Cardoso H,"Objectives. Immune reconstitution therapies (IRT), which include antibody-based cell-depleting therapies targeting CD52+ (alemtuzumab) or CD20+ (rituximab, ocrelizumab) leukocytes, are approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Thyroid autoimmunity is a common adverse effect of alemtuzumab treatment, Graves' disease (GD) being the most prevalent manifestation. To date, thyroid autoimmunity events have not been reported with CD20-targeting monoclonal antibodies. Case Report. A 59-year-old woman with primary progressive multiple sclerosis with no prior personal history of thyroid disease or autoimmunity, was diagnosed with GD 6 months following the first ocrelizumab infusion. She was asymptomatic and had no signs of ophthalmopathy. Due to the temporal association of GD diagnosis with ocrelizumab infusion, absence of symptoms and our experience with alemtuzumab-induced GD, we decided for an active surveillance strategy and antithyroid drugs were not started. She underwent spontaneous resolution of hyperthyroidism with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies (TRAb) negativity and a mild and transitory period of subclinical hypothyroidism, while she continued the biannually ocrelizumab administration schedule. To present date, she has maintained close clinical and biochemical surveillance with normal TSH, free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels and undetectable TRAb. Conclusions. This is the first case of GD reported after ocrelizumab administration. The timing, onset and course of this case is similar to alemtuzumab-induced GD, usually interpreted as an ""immune reconstitution syndrome""; however, ocrelizumab cell count depletion is inferior in severity, cell population affected and duration of depletion. This case highlights the importance of pre-screening and follow-up with thyroid function tests in patients treated with ocrelizumab.

Rashes, nail toxicity, and diarrhea are common adverse events. Hematological adverse effects, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia, have been reported. However, erythrocytosis has not been reported as an adverse event. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of acute lower extremity thrombosis presumably caused by osimertinib-induced erythrocytosis. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old man with epidermal EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC presented with acute left sural pain. The patient's left foot was cold, and peripheral arterial Doppler signals were absent. He had developed erythrocytosis of unknown etiology during osimertinib therapy. Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit were 22.6 g/dL and 62.5%, respectively. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed thrombotic occlusion of the popliteal artery. Other than erythrocytosis, there was no possible cause of arterial thrombosis. Osimertinib was discontinued immediately because the NSCLC started to resist treatment and was presumed to be the cause of erythrocytosis. He received endovascular treatment (EVT). Following serial EVT and debridement, his fourth toe was amputated for necrosis. Erythrocytosis persisted 8 months during osimertinib therapy. Hb levels decreased to 15.4 mg/dL due to blood loss complicated with catheter thrombectomy and remained normal for 20 months after osimertinib discontinuation. The patient died of cancer progression.

A pleural fluid analysis revealed exudative effusion, according to Light's criteria. The fluid was negative for infectious etiology. Chest X-ray, computed tomography, and echocardiography revealed no signs of pericardial effusion or perforation of the pacemaker lead to outside the heart. The pleural effusion persisted despite use of anti-inflammatory medication for several weeks and diuretics for a short period.

CRP, by activating the classical complement pathway and interacting with macrophages via Fc gamma receptors, can cause pulmonary inflammation with subsequent fibrosis. Recently, we have reported first-in-man CRP apheresis in a ""high-risk"" COVID-19 patient. Treatment was unfortunately clinically unsuccessful. Here, we report on successful CRP apheresis treatment in a ""lower-risk"" COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure. CASE REPORT A 39-year-old male patient suffering from fatigue, dyspnea, and fever for 4 days was referred to us. The patient had to be intubated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a throat smear revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mutation analysis revealed the VOC B. 1.1.7 variant. CRP levels were 79.2 mg/L and increased to 161.63 mg/L. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were continuously normal (<0.5 ng/ml). Antibiotic therapy was started to avoid bacterial superinfection. CRP apheresis was performed once via central venous access. CRP levels declined from a maximum of 161.63 mg/L to 32.58 mg/L. No apheresis-associated adverse effects were observed. Subsequently, CRP plasma levels declined day by day and normalized on day 5. The patient was extubated on day 5 and discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on day 6. A second low CRP peak (maximum 22.41 mg/L) on day 7 remained clinically inapparent. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with a CRP level of 6.94 mg/L on day 8.

Several OSDs contain the polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as an excipient. Parenterally administered PVP of high molecular weight may accumulate in tissues and organs. This phenomenon was first described in the 1950s, when PVP was utilised in medication for parenteral use. We report a case of an opioid-addicted patient with extensive PVP-deposition caused by repeated injections of OSDs. Case presentation: A 30-year-old male drug addicted patient in opioid substitution therapy (OST) was repeatedly referred to his local hospital in a poor general condition. Work-up revealed severe normocytic anaemia, renal insufficiency, pancreas insufficiency and pathological fractures. Biopsies from fractured bones, bone marrow and gastric mucosa showed extensive infiltrates of histiocytes with intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Vacuole content stained slightly bluish in hematoxylin and eosin stain, red in Congo red stain and black in periodic acid methenamine silver stain. The morphological appearance and staining properties were in accordance with the diagnosis of PVP deposition. The patient had been injecting both buprenorphine tablets and a specific methadone syrup for several years. The methadone syrup contained large amounts of high molecular weight PVP, making it the most likely cause of the deposition. His health quickly deteriorated and he died, impaired by multi-organ failure and cachexia, five years after the first diagnosis of PVP-deposition. The autopsy revealed extensive PVP-deposition in all sampled organs and tissues. Conclusions: Histological investigation and the correct identification of PVP in the biopsies led to the discovery of a severe adverse effect from long-standing misuse of a drug. The disseminated PVP deposition likely contributed to multi-organ dysfunction and cachexia with a fatal outcome. The deposited PVP likely originated from repeated injections of a certain methadone syrup.",2021,20210419.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a case of polyvinylpyrrolidone deposition disease due to opioid substitution drugs, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses a case of polyvinylpyrrolidone deposition disease due to opioid substitution drugs, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Summary: A 46-year-old woman with history of bipolar disorder with psychotic features presented to the intensive care unit with asterixis and elevations in liver enzymes. The patient had been initiated on risperidone, clozapine, and lithium approximately 1 month prior to admission. After ruling out other possible non-drug etiologies, clozapine was suspected as the likeliest cause of the acute liver injury. Her acute liver injury was managed with the discontinuation of all antipsychotics, administration of IV NAC, and other standard of care supportive measures. Conclusion: Although clozapine has been associated with hepatitis and acute liver failure, there are no reports of NAC used in the management of clozapine-induced hepatotoxicity.

34260572,PMC8284748,"Image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumor of the knee: Case report and review of the literature.",Xiang X||Jiang W||Qiu C||Xiao N||Liang J,"RATIONALE: Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a neoplastic, inflammatory disease with a benign but aggressive course that often presents as localized (TGCT-L) and diffuse (TGCT-D) forms based on the growth pattern and clinical behavior. For TGCT-L, simple excision of the diseased synovial tissue is the preferred treatment option, while for TGCT-D, adequate synovectomy is usually tricky but is essential. However, approximately 44% of TGCT-D cases will relapse after surgery alone. Thus, the optimal treatment strategy in patients with TGCT-D is evolving, and standalone surgical resection can no longer be regarded as the only treatment. The previous studies have shown that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy can reduce recurrence in TGCT, especially in patients with incomplete synovectomy. PATIENT CONCERNS: In the first case, a 54-year-old male presented with recurrent pain and swelling of the right knee with a protracted disease course (>/=10 years). The other patient is a 64-year-old male who developed swelling, pain, abnormal bending, and limited movement of the left knee without obvious inducement. DIAGNOSES: Clinical and imaging examinations can provide a definitive diagnosis, and pathology is the gold standard. TGCT-D was confirmed by postoperative pathology. After the operation, the patients underwent an MRI re-examination and showed that the lesions of the knee were not completely resected. INTERVENTIONS: Arthroscopic synovectomy was performed on the patients, and postoperative pathology was confirmed as TGCT-D. Because of incomplete synovectomy, the 2 cases received image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) after the operation. OUTCOMES: The follow-up time was 1 year, no evidence of disease progression was found in MRI. No obvious adverse effects associated with radiotherapy were detected during the follow-up period. LESSONS: These cases and reviews illustrate the necessity of radiotherapy for TGCT-D and that IG-IMRT is a safe and effective method for treating TGCT-D of the knee.",2021 Jul 16,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses the treatment of diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumor and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses the treatment of diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumor and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

The recent identification of actionable molecular targets in SGNs has led to the evaluation of targeted therapies in non-approved advanced SGNs. CASE REPORT: We present the case of an elderly male with HER-2 Neu overexpressing metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) who demonstrated a prompt and sustained disease response to targeted therapies directed against HER-2 Neu with long survival interrupted by hepatoxicity to Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) treatment.Management and Outcome: The patient was started on Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab on a clinical trial and resulted in an objective improvement sustained over 3 years. Following the disease progression, TDM-1 was started with a response until the patient developed severe hepatotoxicity as an adverse effect of TDM-1 therapy resulting in its discontinuation. Close follow-up post-treatment-discontinuation demonstrated continued clinical improvement until 6 months, when the patient developed brain metastasis. He passed away a few months later in hospice care. DISCUSSION: The metastatic MEC in our patient overexpressed HER-2 Neu. Owing to Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab response, Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) was initiated on a compassionate basis which further extended the survival but had to be terminated owing to adverse effects. Given the paucity of data on targeted therapies in the treatment of metastatic SGNs and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TDM-1 therapy among the elderly, further studies are warranted to answer these important questions and to identify eligible patients for this novel treatment option.",2021 Oct,20210713.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma and the therapeutic response to HER-2 Neu targeted therapies, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma and the therapeutic response to HER-2 Neu targeted therapies, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,90,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 58 patients with progressive stroke caused by large intracranial vascular occlusion exceeding the time window of 24 hours treated in the stroke center of our hospital for three years were retrospectively analyzed . According to the applied therapy, 58 patients were divided into the endovascular (n = 19) and drug (n = 39) therapy groups. Then, modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates, mortality rates and adverse events were assessed in both groups within 90 days. RESULTS: The 90-day good prognosis rate was significantly higher in the endovascular therapy group compared with the drug group (68.4% VS 38.5%, odds ratio [OR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.92; P = 0.032). The 90-day NIHSS scores were lower in the endovascular therapy group compared with the drug group (3.3 +/- 2.6 VS 5.2 +/- 3.0, OR = -1.89; 95%CI, -3.50 to -0.27; P = 0.023). Meanwhile, the proportion of patients with a Barthel index of 90-100 was significantly higher in the endovascular therapy group compared with the drug group (53.0% VS 25.6%, OR = 0.31; 95%CI, 0.10-0.98; P = 0.042). Finally, both groups showed similar rates of adverse events.

METHODS: To better characterise the disease, we collected all cases from French Pharmacovigilance centres recorded over a 20-year period (37 cases) and performed a Medline literature search up to June 2020 (57 cases). RESULTS: In all, 94 patients were identified (male/female ratio: 2.2) of mean age 73.5+/-12.1 years (31-94). Patients were treated with enoxaparin (n=66), unfractionated heparin (n=11), fondaparinux (n=10), tinzaparin (n=4), bemiparin (n=1), reviparin (n=1), dalteparin (n=1), and 4 with other anticoagulants: warfarin (n=3) and rivaroxaban (n=1). All cases presented with 1 to more than 100 haemorrhagic vesicles and bullae, distant from the injection sites, located mainly on the lower (75%) or upper limbs (69%). The lesions were asymptomatic, except in 5 patients who had pruritic or painful lesions. The interval between treatment initiation and BHD ranged from 6 hours to 30 days (mean: 8.4+/-7 days). Biopsy (n=53) showed intraepidermal or subcorneal cavity with red cells (n=39) or junctional blisters (n=10), with eosinophilic infiltrate only rarely. Direct immuno-fluorescence was negative in 19/20 cases and indirect immunofluorescence was negative in 8/8. The outcome was favourable in all cases, including in 12 patients for whom heparin was maintained. A 93-year-old patient died of compressive haematomas unrelated to BHD. We found 5 cases similar to BHD due to other anticoagulants. DISCUSSION: This is the largest comprehensive series of this adverse effect due to heparins or, more rarely, to other anticoagulants. Dermatologists must be aware of BHD, since this benign side effect does not necessarily require interruption of treatment. It is rare, considering the large-scale prescription of heparins, and occurs mainly in male patients aged over 70. Although the presentation is highly typical, the physiopathology is difficult to understand, as coagulation parameters are usually normal.

34162250,,Capecitabine induced Steven-Johnson syndrome: A rare case report.,Karthikeyan K||Sameera KV||Shaji S||Swetha MAC||Madhu CS,"INTRODUCTION: Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious mucocutaneous reaction, characterized by fever, influenza-like symptoms and followed by dermatological manifestations. Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate analogue of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). It is widely accepted for many malignancies because of its better safety profile and tolerability. Hand-foot syndrome is the common dermatological toxicity associated with Capecitabine and SJS is the rarest manifestation.Case presentation: We report a case of Capecitabine induced SJS in a 70 years old male patient with metastatic carcinoma pancreas. He was treated with intravenous Gemcitabine and Carboplatin initially and then switched to oral therapy with Capecitabine 1000 mg twice daily. After ten days of treatment with Capecitabine, he developed vomiting, mucositis, hyperpigmentation, itching and scrotal mucosal peeling. The clinical status of the patient was suggestive of SJS, which was confirmed by dermatologic consultation. According to Naranjo, WHO-UMC, and Hartwig's scale, the reaction was found to be probable and severe. Pharmacological as well as supportive care measures were provided, but the condition progressively worsened, and the patient was deceased. CONCLUSION: Capecitabine can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions which can be dangerous and life-threatening. Health care providers must be aware of all rare adverse effects, including SJS.

34160456,PMC8238293,Favorable response to second-line atezolizumab and bevacizumab following progression on nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A case report demonstrating that anti-VEGF therapy overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition.,Swed B||Ryan K||Gandarilla O||Shah MA||Brar G,"RATIONALE: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a deadly disease in part due to decades of limited therapeutic options. With recent advances in our understanding of the tumor biology, several promising treatment strategies involving targeted and immunotherapies have emerged. However, enhancing their modest efficacy in HCC and other gastrointestinal malignancies is essential to improving survival. PATIENT CONCERNS: A man in his late 50s with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity initially presented with progressive abdominal pain and anorexia prompting an abdominal computed tomography scan that revealed a large solitary liver mass with extensive local involvement. DIAGNOSES: Although there were features consistent with a primary gastric tumor on subsequent endoscopic evaluation leading to early diagnostic uncertainty, his clinical picture, including a dominant liver mass, immunohistochemical staining profile, and significantly elevated alpha fetoprotein ultimately favored HCC. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received palliative systemic therapy with infusional fluorouracil for a presumed gastric primary, however restaging scans after 3 cycles demonstrated disease progression. The consensus from a multidisciplinary discussion was that his pathology was more consistent with primary HCC. He was subsequently started on nivolumab with a partial response, although after 5 months, he progressed prompting initiation of second-line atezolizumab and bevacizumab with a favorable response. OUTCOMES: The addition of atezolizumab and bevacizumab led to a sustained biochemical and radiographic response that appeared to overcome the resistance to nivolumab monotherapy. Aside from several mild immune-related adverse effects, his quality of life has greatly improved and he has tolerated treatment well to date. LESSONS: Our findings suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition can overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibition in advanced HCC by resulting in a unique synergy that has never before been described in patients. The biological rationale for this response is likely attributable to the immunomodulatory effects of antiangiogenic agents, promoting an immunostimulatory microenvironment that can be exploited by immune checkpoint inhibitors for more effective antitumor activity. Given the considerable benefit patients may derive following progression on first-line treatment, it is important to consider this strategic combination of therapies which can ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.",2021 Jun 25,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

However, the ST prophylaxis, sensitive to Nocardia species, sometimes induces renal toxicities. Therefore, alternative prophylactic or therapeutic drugs are required for nocardiosis in HSCT patients. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old Japanese man with acute mixed phenotypic leukemia with t(9; 22) received allogenic peripheral blood HSCT from a haplo-identical sibling donor. He developed graft versus host disease (GVHD) with grade II, and was treated with prednisolone and cyclosporine A with concurrent ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, valacyclovir, and ST. However, the prophylactic ST was ceased because of its renal toxicity. He developed a pulmonary nodular lesion with elevated ss-D-glucan and Aspergillus galactomannan antigen. Repeated blood and sputum culture isolated no pathogens. Voriconazole treatment administered once improved these lesions and laboratory findings. One month later, he presented with right pleuritic chest pain and multiple ring-enhancing cavitation lesions along the ribs. A needle biopsy demonstrated Nocardia elegans, which is an extremely rare infection induced by Nocardia species, in the cavitation lesions, shown by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. He was started on doripenem and liposomal amphotericin B, and a subsequent treatment kept him free from Nocardia elegans infection, without any adverse effects, while continuing the cyclosporine A and prednisolone treatment for chronic GVHD.

Neutropenia and cardiac events including sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular block have been previously reported as adverse effects of LCM. To date, there have been no reports of severe agranulocytosis resulting in death associated with LCM. Additionally, there have been no reports of concomitant SND and agranulocytosis after LCM administration. Herein we report the first case of LCM-induced severe SND followed by agranulocytosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient with focal epilepsy was initiated on LCM 100 mg/day and the dose was increased to 200 mg/day on the 9(th) hospital day. Severe SND developed on the 10(th) hospital day and LCM was discontinued. Thereafter agranulocytosis appeared on the 11(th) hospital day, and the patient died from septic shock on the 15(th) hospital day.

Upon initial presentation he was tachycardic, hypotensive and had leukocytosis. While he had signs of acute kidney injury, no signs of acute liver injury were present with his alanine transferase (ALT) and amino transferase (AST) levels measuring at 22 and 44 U/L, respectively. During the treatment course the patient began to show signs of clinical improvement. Despite this, his ALT and AST began to increase on day 2 of treatment and reached their peak of 210 and 239 U/L on day 4. Cefepime-induced liver injury was suspected and cefepime was discontinued. Upon cefepime discontinuation, liver enzymes downtrended and gradually returned to normal. No other likely medication causes of liver injury could be identified and alternative medical causes were ruled out. The lack of an alternative cause and the temporal relationship of cefepime use to hepatic dysfunction support the diagnosis of cefepime-induced liver injury. The patient's Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Methods score was 7, indicating this was a possible case of cefepime-induced liver injury, and the Naranjo Nomogram score was 5 indicating this was a probable case of cefepime-induced liver injury.

However, CPA-associated severe enteritis is a rare adverse effect, and only one case with a lethal clinical course has been reported. Therefore, the appropriate management of patients with CPA-associated severe enteritis is unclear. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 61-year-old woman diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis based on the presence of symptoms in ear, lung, and, kidney with positive myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. She received pulsed methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone 55 mg/d and intravenous CPA at a dose of 500 mg/mo. Ten days after the second course of intravenous CPA, she developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was admitted to the hospital. Laboratory testing revealed hypoalbuminemia, suggesting protein-losing enteropathy. Computed tomography revealed wall thickening of the stomach, small intestine, and colon with contrast enhancement on the lumen side. Antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapy were not effective, and the patient's enteritis did not improve for > 4 mo. Because her condition became seriously exhausted, corticosteroids were tapered and supportive therapies including intravenous hyperalimentation, replenishment of albumin and gamma globulin, plasma exchange, and infection control were continued. These supportive therapies improved her condition, and her enteritis gradually regressed. She was finally discharged 7 mo later. CONCLUSION: Immediate discontinuation of CPA and intensive supportive therapy are crucial for the survival of patients with CPA-associated severe enteritis.",2021 May 28,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications associated with cyclophosphamide treatment, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications associated with cyclophosphamide treatment, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

34061189,,Extrapyramidal Symptoms Induced by Treatment for Delirium: A Case Report.,Santos CD||Rose MQ,"INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotics are a treatment option for delirium in the intensive care unit. Atypical antipsychotics are preferred over first-generation antipsychotics because of their lower incidence of extrapyramidal adverse effects. The most common such effect is akathisia or restlessness. This report describes a case of atypical antipsychotic-induced akathisia and addresses the clinical distinction between extrapyramidal movements and movements due to intensive care unit delirium. CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 56-year-old man who had a prolonged hospital stay after orthotopic liver transplant complicated by multisystem organ failure, primary graft failure requiring a second transplant, and enterocutaneous fistula developed agitated delirium on hospital day 28. Initial treatment included intravenous haloperidol and scheduled sublingual olanzapine (5 mg daily). His delirium and insomnia persisted, requiring dexmedetomidine infusion. Olanzapine dosing was increased to 10 mg daily on hospital day 34 and 15 mg daily on hospital day 45. The following day, his mentation improved; however, he exhibited asynchronous, nonrhythmic, involuntary rolling motions of his hands and choreiform gait. DIAGNOSIS AND OUTCOMES: Antipsychotics were immediately discontinued owing to acute akathisia. All symptoms resolved within 2 days, and the patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit on hospital day 52. CONCLUSION: Although extrapyramidal adverse effects are less common with olanzapine than with typical antipsychotics, they sometimes occur and can mimic manifestations of delirium. Restlessness should alert the nurse to assess for possible extrapyramidal adverse effects. If they are suspected, antipsychotic medications should be reduced or discontinued to prevent progression to functional disability.",2021 Jun 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotic treatment for delirium, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotic treatment for delirium, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

We included two patients in the Envision study who responded clinically well to this treatment. However, in both patients, therapy had to be discontinued because of severe adverse effects: One patient (A) developed local injection reactions which continued to spread all over her body with increasing number of injections and eventually caused a severe systemic allergic reaction. Patient B was hospitalized because of a fulminant pancreatitis. Searching for possible causes, we also measured the patients plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels in fluoride-containing collection tubes: by LC-MS/MS unexpectedly, plasma Hcy levels were 100 and 200 in patient A and between 100 and 400 mumol/l in patient B. Searching for germline mutations in 10 genes that are relevant for homocysteine metabolism only revealed hetero- and homozygous polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene. Alternatively, an acquired inhibition of cystathionine-beta-synthase which is important for homocysteine metabolism could explain the plasma homocysteine increase. This enzyme is heme-dependent: when we gave heme arginate to our patients, Hcy levels rapidly dropped. Hence, we conclude that inhibition of  partial differential-ALA-synthase 1 by givosiran causes a drop of free heme in the hepatocyte and therefore the excessive increase of plasma homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to the adverse effects seen in givosiran-treated patients which may be due to protein-N-homocysteinylation.",2021 Jul,20210529.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on adverse effects of givosiran treatment in porphyria patients.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on adverse effects of givosiran treatment in porphyria patients.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to the treatment of porphyria with givosiran, specifically severe adverse effects and elevated homocysteine levels, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to the treatment of porphyria with givosiran, specifically severe adverse effects and elevated homocysteine levels, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,90,,

However, a small number of patients are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, leading to discontinuation of this potentially life-changing therapy. In this study, we present a case of high-grade urothelial carcinoma patient, who experienced neurocomplications during the first pembrolizumab administration. However, we were able to limit the adverse effect by concomitant use of low-dose oral steroids. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Taiwanese female with high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the left ureter came to the neurology clinic with complaints of acute onset of bilateral ptosis 16 days after her first infusion of pembrolizumab. It was found that she developed complete bilateral ptosis and limited extraocular muscle movements. Myasthenia gravis-related antibodies and repetitive stimulation test were negative. We diagnosed her with pembrolizumab-induced myasthenia gravis-like disorder and myositis based on clinical symptoms and elevation of muscle enzymes. We commenced methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral steroid therapy with gradual resolution of the symptoms. Three months later, the patient received a second cycle of pembrolizumab with low-dose oral steroids without any complications. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab exerts its antitumor activity by interfering with the binding of programmed death 1 and its ligand, programmed death ligand 1. As a result, enhanced cytotoxic T cells can recognize tumor cells and induce cellular death. However, neurological complications may be severe and require prompt recognition and treatment. Our case demonstrated that concomitant use of low-dose steroids and pembrolizumab might prevent such complications.",2021 Apr 30,20210430.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.",2,95,,

This review critiques Johnson et al.'s (2016) investigation, titled ""The Impact of Cognitive Stressors in the Emergency Department on Physician Implicit Racial Bias,"" that examined emergency department characteristics and stressors and their effects on physician racial bias and decision making. Their findings suggest that unconscious biases can affect clinical decisions when providers experience increased cognitive stress. The implications are significant for emergency providers as resources are especially strained during the COVID-19 pandemic and as the adverse effects of unconscious bias on health disparities and patient outcomes have become clearly apparent.

33910628,PMC8082960,Dual treatment of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer with tamoxifen: a case report.,Mirfakhraee S||Chan AVC Jr||Ganji N||Abramowitz J,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended for the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are associated with significant musculoskeletal adverse effects, likely through growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 modulation, while tamoxifen reduces insulin-like growth factor 1 production. We describe the case of a patient who was treated successfully with tamoxifen for her hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and acromegaly. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old White female with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer was diagnosed with acromegaly. She received adjuvant endocrine therapy with anastrozole but could not tolerate this medication because of severe arthralgia, so she was switched to tamoxifen. Shortly after starting tamoxifen, the patient's musculoskeletal symptoms resolved and her insulin-like growth factor 1 levels normalized. She has remained in remission of her acromegaly and breast cancer since initiating tamoxifen. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the dual benefit of tamoxifen therapy in the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and acromegaly. Unlike anastrozole, tamoxifen has the benefit of lowering insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, which underscores its advantage in reducing adverse musculoskeletal symptoms during the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. We offer the first reported use of tamoxifen monotherapy for the successful treatment of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. While tamoxifen may offer an additional, oral option for acromegaly patients who do not respond to or tolerate conventional growth-hormone-lowering therapy, additional studies are necessary.",2021 Apr 29,20210429.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the treatment of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer with tamoxifen, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the treatment of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer with tamoxifen, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,

33877741,,Lower eyelid xanthelasma following hyaluronic acid filler injections to the tear troughs.,Liu A||Kollipara R||Hoss E||Goldman MP,"INTRODUCTION: Adverse effects from dermal fillers are uncommon. We report a case of filler-induced xanthelasma at the bilateral infraorbital region in a 43-year-old woman after multiple injections of hyaluronic acid to correct tear trough depression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report a case of a 43-year-old woman with a chief complaint of skin discoloration of the bilateral lower eyelids. Her history was significant for ten sessions of hyaluronic acid filler for tear trough deformity between December 2008 and May 2016. On clinical examination, she exhibited thin, soft, and yellow papules to her lower medial infraorbital hollows. A punch biopsy showed foamy histiocytes with a background of hypervascularization and focal extracellular lipid in the superficial dermis, consistent with xanthelasma. RESULTS: Xanthelasma was treated with multiple passes of Er:YAG laser (Sciton Contour TRL) with a 4 mm spot size, fluence 7.5 J/cm2, and ablate/coagulate 50/50 at 6 Hz until clearance occurred. The perilesional skin was treated with 1-2 passes, fluence 7.5 J/cm2, ablate/coagulate 50/0 to blend in the cosmetic unit. Six-month follow-up showed notable improvement of all lesions. DISCUSSION: There is a paucity of treatments described for filler-induced xanthelasma reaction. While broad conclusions cannot be drawn from one case, our experience indicates that complete resolution can be achieved with Er:YAG ablation. We hypothesize that this laser is an optimal treatment, as it can vaporize the lipid contents while minimizing adverse effects, such as scars and hyperpigmentation.",2021 Oct,20210428.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, focusing instead on a rare complication of hyaluronic acid fillers.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, focusing instead on a rare complication of hyaluronic acid fillers.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of xanthelasma following hyaluronic acid filler injections, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of xanthelasma following hyaluronic acid filler injections, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.",2,95,,

The adverse effect of long-term bisphosphonate administration in the fracture-healing process is controversial. The aim of our study was to observe not only morphology but also morphometry of the fracture site of atypical femoral fracture with and without long-term bisphosphonate administration, in a case study of two difficult-to-obtain human samples. The patients with insufficient healing of atypical femoral fracture were treated with valgus wedge osteotomy. Histomorphometrical analysis was performed in bone samples of fracture sites harvested during osteotomy. The thickness of the femoral cortex was measured in the fracture site and the adjacent, non-fracture site. A comparative analysis of the content of hypertrophic osteoclasts in fracture sites, shape and size of osteons, mass, and ratio of the woven bone to the total bone mass was performed, comparing bisphosphonate-treated and untreated samples. In bisphosphonate-treated samples, we observed femoral cortex thickening at the fracture site; the appearance of hypertrophic osteoclasts; decreased bone resorption surface, decreased osteoclast numbers on the bone resorption surface, and increased ratio of multinuclear osteoclasts; osteons were misshapen and thin; and the mass and ratio of the woven bone to the total bone mass were higher. This study demonstrated that long-term bisphosphonate administration can alter the morphological features of the fracture site compared to its physiological state.",2021 Apr,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, focusing instead on bisphosphonate treatment and atypical femoral fractures.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, focusing instead on bisphosphonate treatment and atypical femoral fractures.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effects of bisphosphonate treatment on fracture healing, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the effects of bisphosphonate treatment on fracture healing, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

33789597,PMC8010975,Case report: restored vision after ocular Closantel intoxication and blindness.,Khalili MR||Zareei A,"BACKGROUND: Closantel is the best-known anti-parasitic medicine for veterinarians, which is contraindicated in humans. After reviewing the literature on ocular toxicity following mistaken usage of Closantel in humans, this report was found as the first complete restoration of visual function after Closantel intoxication. This report could be useful in anticipating the possibility of a further improvement based on a dose-response relationship. An important point of this report is the apparent reversibility of the vision and Electrophysiological parameters after Closantel intoxication and blindness. To conclude, the present case report demonstrates the importance of immediate referral and management in Closantel intoxication to avoid the long-term adverse effects of drug on visual function. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old man mistakenly took about 20 cc of Closantel 5% (15.87 mg/kg). Four hours after mistaken usage of Closantel, he was transferred to the district hospital due to dizziness and nausea. His stomach was washed out immediately after hospital arrival. He was being hospitalized in that hospital for 3 days. Then, he was referred to our clinic due to progressive vision loss. Methylprednisolone acetate 250 mg was injected once on 5th day after taking Closantel. His vision was reducing gradually so low that he could only detect hand motion (HM) on the 14th day after taking Closantel. ERG test was requested. It showed an exclusive reduction in b-wave amplitude under photopic and scotopic conditions. Later, his vision surprisingly improved gradually and his visual acuity was fully restored on the 28th day after the incident. After 3 years, we checked him again.

33587389,,High-Dose Fluvoxamine Augmentation to Clozapine in Treatment-Resistant Psychosis.,Leising J||Barr AM||Procyshyn RM||Ainsworth NJ||White RF||Honer W||Vila-Rodriguez F,"BACKGROUND: Although clozapine is the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, more than 30% of patients remain unresponsive to clozapine monotherapy and may benefit from augmentation strategies. Fluvoxamine augmentation of clozapine may be beneficial in treatment resistance because of pharmacokinetic interactions, allowing for lower clozapine dosages with higher clozapine serum levels and an increased clozapine-to-norclozapine ratio, which can modify adverse effects. An augmentation strategy using higher fluvoxamine doses may also improve persistent negative, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms through fluvoxamine's serotonergic activity. METHODS: Through chart review, we identified 4 cases of patients with treatment-resistant psychosis who underwent high-dose fluvoxamine augmentation of clozapine to target residual negative symptoms, refractory psychosis, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. FINDINGS: This augmentation strategy continued in 2 patients after discharge who showed clinical improvement without significant adverse effects. Two patients experienced adverse effects that led to the fluvoxamine discontinuation. Despite the fact that fluvoxamine augmentation led to symptom improvement in only 2 patients, all patients achieved high serum clozapine levels. Hematologic parameters were monitored in all patients, and no abnormalities were observed. No severe adverse effects of clozapine were experienced. CONCLUSIONS: Although high variability of responses and adverse effects were observed during fluvoxamine augmentation to clozapine, this strategy was successful in increasing clozapine serum levels. Through fluvoxamine's serotonergic effects, this strategy may confer benefit to residual negative, obsessive, and anxiety symptoms. Limitations of this case series include the retrospective nature, absence of controls, diversity of diagnoses, multiple interventions in each patient, and lack of masked raters.",2021 Mar-Apr 01,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

33550992,PMC7869193,Clozapine intoxication with severe adverse effects induced by an inflammatory and infectious process: a case report.,Bebawi E||Wakim L||Dore M,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine intoxication can be life-threatening. Outside of the common drug-drug interactions, tobacco smoking, and caffeine consumption, infectious and inflammatory processes are important contributors to clozapine intoxication. Although this relationship has been reported previously, the literature is scant of proper research articles describing the presentation and management of this unpredictable interaction. Therefore, clinicians need to rely heavily on case reports describing clozapine intoxication caused by inflammation and/or infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian woman known for schizophrenia was brought to the emergency department (ED) with severe signs and symptoms of clozapine intoxication (general deterioration, drowsiness, neutropenia, and ileus). She was on clozapine 700 mg daily amongst other medications. The clozapine dose was stable for over 3 years, and there were no recent changes in her medications. The initial culprit was determined to be an infectious/inflammatory process of gastrointestinal origin with contribution from dehydration and constipation. Clozapine and norclozapine serum concentrations confirmed the intoxication: 1315 ng/mL and 653 ng/mL, respectively. She drastically improved with clozapine dose reduction and antibiotic therapy. She remained stable for years with clozapine 600 mg daily with stable clozapine serum levels. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates the possibility of severe toxicity associated with an acute infectious and/or inflammatory process in patients on clozapine therapy. Clinicians must maintain a high level of suspicion in patients taking clozapine who develop and an infectious and/or inflammatory process. Constipation secondary to clozapine intoxication can exacerbate the initial intoxication process.",2021 Feb 8,20210208.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses clozapine intoxication and its relationship with infectious and inflammatory processes, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses clozapine intoxication and its relationship with infectious and inflammatory processes, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

33461505,PMC7814578,Identification and molecular characterization of Subramaniula asteroides causing human fungal keratitis: a case report.,Cultrera R||Torelli R||Sarnicola C||Segala D||Mengoli A||Chiaretto G||Perri P||Sanguinetti M,"BACKGROUND: Keratitis due to by filamentous fungi are not easy to diagnose thus causing a delay in correct therapy. There are many descriptions of keratitis due to Candida, Fusarium and Aspergillus genera. Subramaniula genus has only recently been reported to cause human infections and there are few descriptions of eye infections due to this filamentous fungus. Diagnosis of fungal keratitis is usually based on microscopic and cultural techniques of samples obtained by corneal swabbing or scraping. Considering the amount of time required to obtain culture results it is wise to use other diagnostic methods, such as molecular analyses. Therapeutic options against these fungi are limited by low tissue penetration in the eye due to ocular barriers. We describe the first case of S. asteroides human keratitis treated with isavuconazole. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a rare case of fungal keratitis unresponsive to antimicrobial treatment in a 65-year-old male patient without a history of diabetes or immunological diseases. He reported that the onset of symptoms occurred during a long holiday in Cape Verde Island. Initial treatment with topical antibiotics associated to steroids were ineffective, allowing a slow clinical progression of disease to corneal perforation. On admission in our Hospital, slit-lamp examination of the left eye showed conjunctival congestion and hyperemia, a large inferior corneal ulceration with brown pigment, corneal edema, about 3 mm of hypopyon and irido-lenticular synechiae. The slow clinical progression of the disease to corneal perforation and the aspect of the ulcer were consistent with a mycotic etiology. Molecular methods used on fungal colonies isolated by Sabouraud's dextrose agar cultures allowed the identification of Subramaniula asteroids from corneal scraping. Antimicrobial test showed a good susceptibility of this filamentous fungus to voriconazole and isavuconazole. Moreover, this fungal keratitis was successfully treated with isavuconazole, without side effects, observing a progressive clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular methods may be useful for the identification of filamentous fungal keratitis on scraping samples thus shortening the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapy by isavuconazole could be useful to treat the filamentous fungal keratitis, reducing the possible adverse effects due to the use of voriconazole by systemic administration.",2021 Jan 18,20210118.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on fungal keratitis and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on fungal keratitis and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of fungal keratitis caused by Subramaniula asteroides and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of fungal keratitis caused by Subramaniula asteroides and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,

An increase of glycolysis pathway leading to pyruvate escalation is the mechanism of hyperlactatemia in beta2-adrenergic agonist drug. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old man who had poor-controlled asthma, presented with progressive dyspnea with coryza symptom for 6 days. He was intubated and admitted into medical intensive care unit due to deteriorated respiratory symptom. Severe asthmatic attack was diagnosed and approximate 1.5 canisters of salbutamol inhaler was administrated within 24 h of admission. Initial severe acidosis consisted of acute respiratory acidosis from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and acute metabolic acidosis resulting from bronchospasm and hypoxia-related lactic acidosis, respectively. The lactate level was normalized in 6 h after hypoxemia and ventilation correction. Given the lactate level re-elevated into a peak of 4.6 mmol/L without signs of tissue hypoxia nor other possible etiologies, the salbutamol toxicity was suspected and the inhaler was discontinued that contributed to rapid lactate clearance. The patient was safely discharged on the 6th day of admission.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man was diagnosed with a kidney neuroendocrine carcinoma. Three months after kidney resection surgery, the tumor cells had metastasized to his liver and lymph nodes. Subsequently, the patient started chemotherapy; however, regardless of treatment, the tumor grew, and the patient experienced a series of adverse effects, such as taste disorder, anorexia, and general fatigue. Finally, he was administered a programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor, nivolumab (biweekly, toal 200 mg/body), which was effective against kidney carcinoma. However, the patient had a bronchial asthma attack at 22 cycles of nivolumab treatment and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an abnormal bilateral shadow after 37 cycles of nivolumab treatment. Bronchoscopy findings revealed eosinophil infiltration in the lungs along with severe alveolar hemorrhage. Paranasal sinus CT scanning indicated sinusitis and nerve conduction analysis indicated a decrease in his right ulnar nerve conduction velocity. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; he was treated with prednisolone, which alleviated his bronchial asthma. To restart nivolumab treatment, the dose of prednisolone was gradually tapered, and the patient was administered a monthly dose of mepolizumab and biweekly dose of nivolumab. To date, there have been no bronchial attacks or CT scan abnormalities upon follow up. CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case in which a patient with cancer was diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis following treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor.

After 3 months of fenofibrate, her glycemic control had improved and her insulin requirements had decreased, probably as a result of anorexia. Her renal function had also worsened. Dechallenge resulted in near normalization of sweet taste and restoration of her pretreatment renal function 2 weeks later. Rechallenge provoked recurrence of severely impaired sweet taste perception, which led to permanent discontinuation of fenofibrate. CONCLUSIONS This case shows that altered sweet taste perception is a potential clinically significant adverse effect of fenofibrate therapy. There is increasing interest in the function of sweet taste receptors, which are recognized as having a broader role in cellular function and inflammation in tissues such as the kidney and retina that are relevant to type 2 diabetes and its complications.",2020 Nov 20,20201120.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not meet the criteria because it discusses adverse effects of fenofibrate, not COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article does not meet the criteria because it discusses adverse effects of fenofibrate, not COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of fenofibrate on taste perception in a patient with type 2 diabetes, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of fenofibrate on taste perception in a patient with type 2 diabetes, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications.",2,95,,
33191836,,Reduction in Tamoxifen Metabolites Endoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen With Chronic Administration of Low Dose Cannabidiol: A CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Drug Interaction.,Parihar V||Rogers A||Blain AM||Zacharias SRK||Patterson LL||Siyam MA,"BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) serves as a promising medicine, with few known adverse effects apart from the potential of drug interactions with the cytochrome P450 system. It has been hypothesized drug interactions may occur with chemotherapeutic agents, but no supporting evidence has been published to date. CASE: A 58-year-old female with a history of bilateral breast carcinoma in remission, was treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention for over 6 years. CBD was instituted to treat persistent postsurgical pain, inadequately managed by alternate analgesics. It was postulated that CBD may diminish tamoxifen metabolism by CYP3A4 and 2D6 to form active metabolite endoxifen, which exerts the anticancer benefits. Endoxifen, tamoxifen, N-desmetyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen levels were collected while the patient chronically received CBD 40 mg/day, and after a 60-day washout. Upon discontinuation of CBD 40 mg/day, it was observed that endoxifen levels increased by 18.75% and N-desmethyltamoxifen by 9.24%, while 4-hydroxytamoxifen remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: CBD at a low dose of 40 mg/day resulted in the potential inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6. Patients receiving CBD and interacting chemotherapeutic drugs, such as tamoxifen, require monitoring to identify possible subtherapeutic response to treatment. Further pharmacokinetic studies are required to ascertain the dynamics of this drug interaction.",2022 Apr,20201115.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a drug interaction between cannabidiol and tamoxifen.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a drug interaction between cannabidiol and tamoxifen.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the interaction between cannabidiol and tamoxifen, focusing on drug metabolism rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the interaction between cannabidiol and tamoxifen, focusing on drug metabolism rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

The most common presentation is the involvement of peripheral nervous system, usually presenting with subjective symptoms such as paresthesia, dysesthesia, or numbness. Among these compounds, fluconazole has relatively more frequent neurological adverse reactions.A 54-year-old man was admitted with numbness and weakness in his both feet, which gradually worsened and resulted in difficulty in ambulation over time.

Clozapine remains the drug of choice in the management of TRS. Several studies have shown that clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic medication to date for TRS. But it is also well known that it has multiple side effects. Some side effects are transient and relatively benign, while other adverse effects are menacing, serious and life-threatening. Delirium may occur with clozapine and is a therapeutic challenge as there is always a risk of precipitating delirium on clozapine rechallenge. Limited management strategies are available as alternatives for the management of psychiatric illness stabilized on clozapine. In this case report, we describe an older adult patient who developed delirium on clozapine.

33086908,,Temozolomide-induced aplastic anaemia: Case report and review of the literature.,Gilbar PJ||Pokharel K||Mangos HM,"INTRODUCTION: Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent principally indicated for neurological malignancies including glioblastoma (GBM) and astrocytoma. Most common side effects are mild to moderate, and include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Severe or prolonged myelosuppression, causing delayed treatment or discontinuation, is uncommon. Major haematological adverse effects such as myelodysplastic syndrome or aplastic anaemia (AA) have rarely been reported. CASE REPORT: We report a 68-year old female with GBM treated at a tertiary hospital with short-course radiotherapy and concurrent temozolomide following craniotomy. On treatment completion she was transferred to our hospital for rehabilitation. She was thrombocytopenic on admission. Platelets continued falling with significant pancytopenia developing over the next two weeks. Blood parameters and a markedly hypocellular bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis of very severe AA, probably due to TMZ. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Treatment consisted of repeated platelet transfusions, intravenous antibiotics, antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis, and G-CSF 300 mcg daily. Platelet and neutrophil counts had returned to normal at 38 days following the completion of TMZ treatment. DISCUSSION: Whilst most cases of AA are idiopathic, a careful drug, occupational exposure and family history should be obtained, as acquired AA may result from viruses, chemical exposure, radiation and medications. Temozolomide-induced AA is well documented, though only 12 cases have been described in detail. Other potential causes were eliminated in our patient. Physicians should be aware of this rare and potentially fatal toxicity when prescribing.

We herein report two cases of BHT associated with antibacterial agents and review previous cases. In Case 1, a 17-year-old girl with a central neurocytoma was administered intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam for postoperative infection, and BHT developed 12 days later. Her symptoms resolved 8 days after she discontinued the piperacillin-tazobactam and brushed her tongue three times daily. In Case 2, a 65-year-old man was administered intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin to treat multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and BHT developed 15 days later. The piperacillin-tazobactam was discontinued and the patient brushed his tongue, and the discoloration gradually subsided thereafter. However, the BHT reappeared after linezolid treatment. The patient had adverse drug reactions to both the piperacillin-tazobactam and linezolid treatments. The BHT might have been related to antibiotic use in both cases. We identified 19 cases of antibiotic-related BHT in a literature search, but none were related to piperacillin-tazobactam use.

SUMMARY: A 37-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for ileocolonic fistulizing Crohn's disease, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presented to an emergency department with shortness of breath, urticaria, and tongue swelling that had developed shortly after initiation of an infusion of infliximab-abda. The patient had no documented allergies at the time of presentation. The patient was taking oral budesonide 9 mg daily and oral azathioprine 50 mg daily for treatment of Crohn's disease. Other medications included oral omeprazole 40 mg every morning for GERD and oral sertraline 100 mg daily for depression. The patient's tongue swelling worsened, and he was intubated for airway protection. The patient received supportive care treatment for angioedema with intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 8 mg every 8 hours, IV diphenhydramine 50 mg every 8 hours, and IV famotidine 20 mg every 12 hours. He was extubated approximately 43 hours later and observed overnight in a medical intensive care unit. He was transferred to a general medicine unit the next day for further care. The total hospital length of stay was 4 days. CONCLUSION: A 37-year-old man developed infusion-related angioedema with use of infliximab-abda.

Onset of hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), among other symptoms, occurs within hours of ingestion. Moreover, patients who experience hyperpyrexia, altered mental status, DIC, and multiorgan failure, rarely survive. This case presents a chronic ecstasy user whose symptoms would have predicted mortality. The report demonstrates a patient who experiences protracted hyperthermia, with delayed rhabdomyolysis and DIC. In addition, his peak creatine kinase (CK) of 409,440 U/L was far greater than the expected 30,000 to 100,000 U/L, being the second largest CK recorded in a survivor. PATIENT CONCERNS: This case report presents a 20-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after experiencing a severe reaction to ecstasy. He was a chronic user who took his baseline dosage while performing at a music event. He experienced hyperpyrexia immediately (106.5 degrees F) while becoming stiff and unresponsive. Before emergency medical service arrival, his friends placed cold compresses on the patient and rested him in an ice filled bathtub. DIAGNOSES: Per history from patient's friends and toxicology results, the patient was diagnosed with ecstasy overdose, which evolved to include protracted hyperthermia and delayed rhabdomyolysis. INTERVENTIONS: Due to a Glasgow coma scale score of 5, he was intubated and sedated with a propofol maintenance. Hyperpyrexia resolved (temperature dropped to 99.1 degrees F) after start of propofol maintenance. He was extubated after 24 hours, upon which he experienced hyperthermia (101.4 degrees F at 48 hours), delayed rhabdomyolysis, and DIC (onset at 37 hours). He remained in hyperthermia for 120 hours until carvedilol permanently returned his temperature to baseline. His plasma CK reached a peak of 409,440 U/L at 35 hours. OUTCOMES: After primary management with intravenous fluids, the patient returned to baseline health without any consequences and was discharged after 8 days. A follow-up of 3 months postdischarge revealed no complications or disability. LESSONS: Clinically, the case highlights how physicians should be aware of the unusual time course adverse effects of ecstasy can have.

MTC derives from the neural crest and secretes calcitonin (CTN) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Unlike differentiated thyroid cancer, MTC does not uptake iodine and I-131 RAI (radioactive iodine) treatment is ineffective. Patients with metastatic disease are candidates for FDA-approved agents with either vandetanib or cabozantinib; however, adverse effects limit their use. There are ongoing trials exploring the role of less toxic immunotherapies in patients with MTC. We present a 61-year-old male with the diagnosis of MTC and persistent local recurrence despite multiple surgeries. He was started on sunitinib, but ultimately its use was limited by toxicity. He then presented to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and was enrolled on a clinical trial with heat-killed yeast-CEA vaccine (NCT01856920) and his calcitonin doubling time improved in 3 months. He then came off vaccine for elective surgery. After surgery, his calcitonin was rising and he enrolled on a phase I trial of avelumab, a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor (NCT01772004). Thereafter, his calcitonin decreased > 40% on 5 consecutive evaluations. His tumor was subsequently found to express PD-L1. CEA-specific T cells were increased following vaccination, and a number of potential immune-enhancing changes were noted in the peripheral immunome over the course of sequential immunotherapy treatment.

A Case Study.,Gajda R||Walasek P||Jarmuszewski M,"The impact of ultramarathons (UM) on the organs, especially in professional athletes, is poorly understood. We tested a 36-year-old UM male runner before and after winning a 24-h marathon. The primary goal of the study was cardiovascular assessment. The athlete experienced right knee pain for the first time after 12 h of running (approximately 130 km), which intensified, affecting his performance. The competitors ran on a 1984 m rectangle-loop (950 x 42 m) in an atypical clockwise fashion. The winner completed 516 rectangular corners. Right knee Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) one day after the run showed general overload in addition to degenerative as well as specific features associated with ""turning to the right"". Re-examination after three years revealed none of these findings. Different kinds of overloading of the right lower limb, including right knee pain, were indicated in 6 of 10 competitors from the top 20, including a woman who set the world record. The affected competitors suggested as cause for discomfort the shape of the loop and running direction. They believed that changing the direction of the run during the competition and an athletics stadium loop shape on a 2000-2500 m length is better for 24-h UM runners. In the absence of technical alternatives, the ""necessary evil"" is a counterclockwise run (also Association of Athletics Federations IAAF recommendation). Results suggest that a one-way, clockwise, 24-h UM run had an adverse effect on the athlete's right knee, as a result of unsymmetrical load. Organizers of 24-h UM runs should consider the shape of the competition loop and apply the principle of uniform load on the musculoskeletal system (alternate directions run).

32819263,,Tofacitinib-induced Ramsay- Hunt Syndrome in a Patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis.,Kobak S,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint and systemic involvement. Tofacitinib is a JAK- inhibitor that is an effective agent in the treatment of active RA. Varicella zoster virus(VZV) reactivation is among the most important adverse effects of tofacitinib. Ramsay-Hunt syndrome(RHS) is a rare clinical condition that develops as a result of VZV reactivation and progresses with hearing loss, dizziness, and facial nerve paralysis. OBJECTIVE: To present a case of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome due to varicella zoster reactivation in a RA patient using tofacitinib. CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old female RA patient under tofacitinib treatment was admitted to the rheumatology outpatient clinic due to widespread skin rashes on her face and ear, and hearing loss. On inspection widespread erythematous, vesicular rashes on the left side of the face, lips, around the eye and in the ear, and mild facial paralysis on the left side were detected. On laboratory investigations, acute phase reactants were increased. Serological study for specific antibodies against varicella zoster virus showed higher titers. Dermatology and ear nose throat specialist consultations were performed, and varicella zoster lesions on the left inner ear, face, and mild facial paresis were considered. According to clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with RHS triggered by tofacitinib. Tofacitinib and methotrexate were discontinued, and intravenous acyclovir was started. On the control examination, the patient's skin lesions and facial nerve paralysis regressed. CONCLUSION: Herein, we reported the first case of tofacitinib-induced RHS in a patient with RA.

We have previously shown that PAS consisting of TMS pulses given at 100% of stimulator output and high-frequency PNS is beneficial for motor rehabilitation of patients with a chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The therapeutic possibilities of this PAS variant for walking rehabilitation of paraplegic patients are unexplored. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year old man with traumatic incomplete paraplegia (AIS D, neurological level T7) received PAS to his left leg for 3 months at 12 months post injury (PAS1) and for an additional 3 months at 24 months post injury (PAS2). The right leg had normal AIS scores and was not stimulated. Before PAS, the patient was nonambulatory, could not stand without weight support, and was consequently not eligible for conventional walking rehabilitation. After PAS1, the patient could stand for 1.5 min and take 13 steps (24 steps in follow up) on parallel bars without weight support and was enrolled into conventional walking rehabilitation. He achieved independent walking ability with a rollator. During PAS2, walking distance increased 2.4 times faster than during the preceding year. The left leg AIS score and spinal cord independence measure mobility subscore increased. No adverse effects were detected. DISCUSSION: This is the first report of PAS with a high-frequency peripheral component that enabled and promoted walking rehabilitation.

However, a rare etiology of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) related to PPI was recently reported. Therefore, the putative role of PPIs in SIADH cannot be underestimated. A 78-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital for treatment of left Bell's palsy. On admission, the patient was oriented with normal laboratory data, including a serum Na level of 135 mEq/L. Oral glucocorticoids and a proton pump inhibitor were initiated in combination with oral valaciclovir. Six days later, the patient's consciousness became impaired. Laboratory data showed a serum Na level of 103 mEq/L, a urine Na level of 64.8 mEq/L, a urine K level of 43.6 mEq/L, and a urine osmolality of 450 mOsm/kg H(2)O. The patient met the criteria for SIADH. The initial treatment included water restriction and 3% hypertonic saline administration. The cessation of PPI significantly improved the urine diluting capacity and concomitantly increased serum Na, which indicated that the use of PPI had been responsible for the etiology of SIADH.

More to the point, medication of acute urticaria always demands high doses, which may cause some adverse effects. Acupuncture, with a history for over 2000 years, has been utilized in clinical practice as an alternative treatment strategy for dermatologic diseases. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 26-year-old male nurse on duty suddenly fell sick during the night-shift in the ward. Wheals began spreading all over his body, but he had no urticaria medicine on hand. The unbearable itching made it extremely difficult for him to resume working. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute urticaria according to the symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: A 30-minute acupuncture treatment was performed. OUTCOMES: About 5 minutes after needles were inserted into the acupoints, the patient felt significantly relieved of itching sensation; moreover, he could even subjectively control himself from scratching and could calmly wait for gradual disappearance of the wheals. Then 30 minutes later, the wheals almost faded away.

Gefitinib is an oral, reversible, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor used in advance non-small cell lung cancer. Skin rashes and diarrhea are common adverse effects associated with gefitinib. However, electrolytes disorders are rarely reported with gefitinib, particularly hyponatremia. CASE REPORT: We describe a 65-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with gefitinib for the last three weeks. He presented to our hospital with complaints of acute onset drowsiness. On evaluation of drowsiness, patient was diagnosed with severe hyponatremia.Management and outcome: After ruling out other common causes of hyponatremia, gefitinib was attributed as a cause of hyponatremia. Gefitinib was immediately stopped and IV hypertonic saline (3% sodium chloride) was started due to severe symptomatic hyponatremia. After seven days of cessation of gefitinib, he became asymptomatic with normalisation of serum sodium levels. DISCUSSION: Hyponatremia in cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis and prolonged hospital stay.

32620953,,Rapid transition from oral selexipag to parenteral treprostinil in a patient with mixed-etiology pulmonary hypertension.,Radosevich JJ||DeChristopher A||Irandost M||Fann J||Feldman J,"PURPOSE: Selexipag is an oral nonprostanoid IP prostacyclin receptor agonist that is indicated for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In patients with continued symptoms of PAH despite maximized oral therapy with selexipag and other oral therapies, a transition to parenteral prostacyclin may be warranted. There is a paucity of data regarding how to safely transition from oral selexipag to parenteral treprostinil. We describe rapid transition from oral selexipag to parenteral treprostinil in this case report. SUMMARY: A 65-year-old female with mixed-etiology PAH as result of pulmonary fibrosis related to polymyositis was admitted to the intensive care unit to be transitioned from selexipag to treprostinil due to dyspnea at rest despite therapy with selexipag 1,600 mg twice daily and macitentan 10 mg daily for 3 years. At baseline the patient required oxygen support (4 L/min) at rest to maintain oxygen saturation at or above 90%. Right heart catheterization performed 8 weeks prior to admission revealed severe PAH, with a pulmonary arterial pressure of 73/27 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance of 10 Wood units. On the day of admission the patient was given selexipag 800 microg at 9 am and simultaneously started on intravenous (i.v.) treprostinil at a dose of 2 ng/kg/min. The treprostinil dose was increased by 2 ng/kg/min every 3 hours until a target dose of 22 ng/kg/min was achieved, at which point the patient had experienced dyspnea improvement. She experienced a mild headache and flushing during rapid treprostinil dose escalation. After 30 hours of i.v. treprostinil infusion, the patient was transitioned to subcutaneous treprostinil therapy and discharged. CONCLUSION: In this case the patient was rapidly transitioned from oral selexipag to i.v. and then subcutaneous treprostinil therapy over a 30-hour period, with minimal adverse effects.",2020 Jul 23,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the transition from oral selexipag to parenteral treprostinil in a patient with pulmonary hypertension and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the transition from oral selexipag to parenteral treprostinil in a patient with pulmonary hypertension and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Few adverse effects have been reported in the literature and ixekizumab is not known to increase the risk of viral reactivation. Herein we report the case of an immunocompetent female patient treated with ixekizumab who presented meningoradiculitis due to varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 51-year-old woman, treated with ixekizumab for psoriasis, consulted in March 2018 for left hemicrania headache associated with left facial paralysis, but without fever. Brain MRI scans revealed cerebral venous thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed lymphocytic meningitis and positive VZV-PCR. PCR blood assay for VZV was negative. Blood concentrations of anti-VZV IgG antibody increased while Anti-VZV IgM antibodies remained negative. The final diagnosis was VZV meningoradiculitis complicated by cerebral thrombophlebitis. The absence of skin rash, the rapid increase in anti-VZV IgG antibodies, the absence of anti-VZV IgM antibodies, and the negative blood PCR assay suggested viral reactivation rather than primary infection. The patient received acyclovir and coumadin and her condition improved rapidly. After multidisciplinary discussion, ixekizumab was reintroduced together with valacyclovir prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: This case raises the question of the risk of viral reactivation during treatment with an IL-17 inhibitor and with biologics in general. Neurological and vascular complications of VZV may occur without skin lesions and their occurrence during ixekizumab therapy must be investigated by PCR testing of CSF for VZV DNA.",2020 Oct,20200630.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of meningoradiculitis due to varicella zoster virus reactivation in a patient treated with ixekizumab, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of meningoradiculitis due to varicella zoster virus reactivation in a patient treated with ixekizumab, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,
32611269,,Successful treatment of refractory secondary immune thrombocytopenia (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome-associated) with the combination of rituximab and romiplostim at the cost of severe bone pain: A case report and review of literature.,Yassa G||Shakir AR||Jagarlamudi K||Yassa AE,"INTRODUCTION: Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder associated with increased thrombocyte destruction and impaired production in the bone marrow. Proposed mechanisms include an antibody or autoreactive T-cell-associated autoimmunity and thrombopoietin deficiency among others. Clinical manifestations are predominantly mucocutaneous hemorrhages including petechiae, purpura, mucosal bleeding in the urinary or the gastrointestinal tracts, menorrhagia, and epistaxis. The purpose of the treatment is to prevent bleeding rather than normalizing the platelet counts. First-line treatments include corticosteroids +/- intravenous immunoglobulin and Anti-D which mainly decrease antibody-mediated platelet destruction and increase the number of peripheral Tregs. Second-line and subsequent therapies include splenectomy, chimeric anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab), which eliminates B cells and act as an immunomodulatory agent, and Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (romiplostim), which promote platelet production. CASE REPORT: We describe a 40-year-old male patient diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia that was refractory to first-line corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin and second-line romiplostim monotherapy treatments.Management and outcome: The patient was given the romiplostim and rituximab combination which not only successfully treated thrombocytopenia but also resulted in grade 3 bone pains and the patient's subsequent refusal to continue therapy. DISCUSSION: Common adverse effects of rituximab are infusion reactions and prolonged immunosuppression; those of romiplostim include thrombosis, headaches, arthralgia-myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. This case shows that romiplostim has not caused any discernible side effects when given alone, while combination with rituximab resulted in severe bone and joint pains.

32580711,PMC7313170,Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease-like uveitis following nivolumab administration treated with steroid pulse therapy: a case report.,Kikuchi R||Kawagoe T||Hotta K,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause various adverse effects. Recently it has been shown that Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease-like uveitis can occur in patients treated with nivolumab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man developed bilateral panuveitis after nivolumab treatment for recurrent hypopharyngeal cancer. Slit lamp examination revealed bilateral granulomatous keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells and partial synechiae. Fundus examination revealed bilateral optic disc edema and diffuse serous retinal detachment. His human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing showed HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele. A lumbar puncture did not demonstrate pleocytosis. Bilateral sub-tenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide were initiated. As his panuveitis did not regress completely, steroid pulse therapy was administered. That therapy led to the resolution of his serous retinal detachment and to rapid improvement in his vision. Following this, we treated him with 50 mg/day of prednisolone for 1 week and then reduced it by 5 mg every week. No bilateral uveitis relapse had occurred by his 3-month follow-up; however, he subsequently died because of his cancer. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with NVKH who underwent a lumbar puncture. Unlike VKH, our case did not show meningismus or pleocytosis. NVKH may, therefore, have a different etiology from VKH.

32476587,,Successful alectinib desensitization in a patient with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung and alectinib-induced drug rash.,Anderson BE||Luczak TS||Ries LM||Hoefs GE||Silva-Benedict AC,"INTRODUCTION: Alectinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as the preferred first-line treatment option for the treatment of metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Skin toxicity is a known adverse effect of this medication, yet current recommendations are unclear regarding how to best manage patients who develop severe skin toxicity while taking alectinib. CASE REPORT: Here, we describe a case of successful rechallenge with alectinib by utilizing a desensitization procedure in a patient who had developed severe alectinib-induced skin toxicity about two weeks into treatment.Management and outcome: Upon resolution of the initial skin toxicity symptoms, the patient was rechallenged with alectinib using a modified version of a previously published desensitization procedure. The patient tolerated the rechallenge with no recurrence of skin toxicity or other adverse effects and was able to continue treatment with alectinib. DISCUSSION: Alectinib is currently recommended as the preferred first-line treatment option for the treatment of metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangement-positive NSCLC due to improved progression-free survival when compared to crizotinib. The development of skin toxicity can lead to early discontinuation of alectinib treatment, forcing providers and patients to select alternative, potentially less effective options.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a co-transplantation of two stem/progenitor cell populations, namely bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and skeletal muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells (SM-SPCs), directly into the dystrophic muscle can improve the skeletal muscle function of DMD patients. Three patients diagnosed with DMD, confirmed by the dystrophin gene mutation, were enrolled into a study approved by the local Bioethics Committee (no. 79/2015). Stem/progenitor cells collected from bone marrow and skeletal muscles of related healthy donors, based on HLA matched antigens, were expanded in a closed MC3 cell culture system. A simultaneous co‑transplantation of BM-MSCs and SM-SPCs was performed directly into the biceps brachii (two patients) and gastrocnemius (one patient). During a six‑month follow‑up, the patients were examined with electromyography (EMG) and monitored for blood kinase creatine level. Muscle biopsies were examined with histology and assessed for dystrophin at the mRNA and protein level. A panel of 27 cytokines was analysed with multiplex ELISA. We did not observe any adverse effects after the intramuscular administration of cells. The efficacy of BM‑MSC and SM‑SPC application was confirmed through an EMG assessment by an increase in motor unit parameters, especially in terms of duration, amplitude range, area, and size index. The beneficial effect of cellular therapy was confirmed by a decrease in creatine kinase levels and a normalised profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines. BM-MSCs may support the pro-regenerative potential of SM-SPCs thanks to their trophic, paracrine, and immunomodulatory activity. Both applied cell populations may fuse with degenerating skeletal muscle fibres in situ, facilitating skeletal muscle recovery.

Phlegmonous gastritis (PG) is a rare acute bacterial infection associated with high mortality, requiring early diagnosis, and prompt management. In addition, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) occasionally requires early treatment and intensive care management due to the occurrence of severe neuropathy and respiratory failure. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old male was diagnosed with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after the detection of several polypoid tumors with ulcers. The patient underwent chemotherapy for DLBCL and exhibited adverse effects (i.e., fever, vomiting, epigastric pain, and neutropenia). Computed tomography indicated widespread thickening in the gastric wall. Furthermore, approximately 2 weeks later, the patient presented with gradual symmetric lower extremity weakness and respiratory failure due to paralysis of the respiratory muscle. DIAGNOSES: DLBCL was diagnosed through a gastric tumor biopsy. On the basis of the computed tomography findings, a culture of gastric juice, nerve conduction studies, and clinical symptoms, this case of gastric lymphoma was complicated with PG and GBS. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with antimicrobial therapy and administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for PG, and with intravenous immunoglobulin and intensive care management for GBS. OUTCOMES: Despite the aggressive progress of the condition, the patient improved without relapse of DLBCL. CONCLUSION: PG was regarded as a precedent infection of GBS.

A skin biopsy of the lesion was consistent with CUA. The patient failed to improve on calcitriol and cinacalcet and was started on intravenous STS. Subsequently, he developed life threatening metabolic acidosis requiring a bicarbonate drip. He died 12 weeks after his initial diagnosis of CUA. CONCLUSIONS This article seeks to describe how the treatment of CUA; a rare disease with high mortality, is limited by the development of metabolic acidosis when using STS therapy. There is an 80% mortality rate within 6 months from CUA with major adverse effect of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Further research is needed in the field of establishing optimal dosing and frequency.",2020 Apr 27,20200427.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to sodium thiosulfate treatment in calciphylaxis, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to sodium thiosulfate treatment in calciphylaxis, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
32327029,PMC7191119,Three Patients With Acute Pulmonary Damage Following the Use of E-Cigarettes-A Case Series.,Suhling H||Welte T||Fuehner T,"BACKGROUND: The use of e-cigarettes is on the rise around the world. Many case reports of acute lung injury due to e-cigarette use have been published in recent months in the USA, but no comparable cases have emerged in Germany up to the present report. The use of e-cigarettes has risen very rapidly in the USA in recent years, simultaneously with the legalization of marijuana sale in many American states. Most of the cases described there involved the use, not only of nicotine, but of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) as well, though some of the patients had indeed not used additives (e.g. THC). METHODS: We report three cases in Germany of acute pulmonary illness that we consider to have been caused by the use of e-cigarettes. RESULTS: All three patients were hospitalized for acute shortness of breath. Two displayed partial respiratory insufficiency and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. All three stated that they had used ordinary, commercially available e-cigarettes every day for at least the past three months. In the first patient, a 48-year-old man, the complete blood count and bronchial lavage findings indicated eosinophilic inflammation. The second patient, a 22-year-old man, developed multiple episodes of hemoptysis, with computed tomography (CT) showing diffuse alveolar bleeding; his complete blood count also revealed eosinophilic inflammation. The third patient, a 34-year-old man, displayed acute ground-glass lung opacities as well as fibrosing changes on CT corresponding to pulmonary sarcoidosis. All three recovered on high-dose systemic corticosteroid treatment and were discharged from the hospital in 2 to 12 days. CONCLUSION: In the first two cases, acute pulmonary injury was very likely due to e-cigarette consumption, as all other possible causes were ruled out. A possible link to e-cigarette use was present in the third case. We thus describe the first three suspected cases of acute lung disease due to e-cigarette use in Germany. These patients do not share any common, typical clinical picture; rather, their symptoms represent different components of the wide spectrum of interstitial lung disease. A uniform national registry should be established to improve our understanding of the adverse effects of e-cigarettes and the resulting acute and chronic changes in the lungs.",2020 Mar 13,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Treatment of EPS consists of discontinuation of PD and maintenance of nutritional status, whereas the role of corticosteroids, tamoxifen and other immunosuppresive agents is not yet fully elucidated. CASE-PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 28-year-old patient, who developed a severe form of calcifying EPS after a 6-year-long therapy with automated PD. The clinical presentation was severe with repeated episodes of total bowel obstruction, weight loss and malnutrition that mandated his prolonged hospitalization. Initial treatment included corticosteroids and tamoxifen (20 mg/day) with a clinically meaningful improvement in gastrointestinal function and nutritional status over the first 6-12 months. Corticosteroids were discontinued at 18 months, but owing to persistence of calcifying lesions and peritoneal thickening in repeated computed-tomography (CT) scans, tamoxifen remained unmodified at a low-dose of 20 mg/day for a 10-year-long period. During follow-up, the patient remained symptoms-free in an excellent clinical condition and the CT findings were unchanged.

32233624,,Antipsychotics-associated obsessive-compulsive symptoms: individualized treatments and clinical benefits of memantine: a case report.,Li H||Xing M||Zhang C,"Antipsychotics with a prominent anti-serotoninergic profile have risks of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). These types of OCS are remain mostly intractable to existing treatments because of the dilemma between the antipsychotic effects and the OCS adverse effects, both of which brought by serotoninergic-blocking profile. This state forced us to seek non-serotonergic system pharmaceuticals. Memantine, as a glutamatergic drug, is the adjunctive agent most consistently showing an effective impact in primary OCD, however its benefit in antipsychotics-associated OCS has not been reported. Herein, we presented a case of a 34-year-old male schizophrenia patient who experienced antipsychotics-associated OCS which could not be relieved by routine managements. He had fallen into dilemma of either aggravated OCS or poorly controlled schizophrenia. Eventually his condition got significant relief by individualized utilization of antipsychotics to control psychosis and by memantine to deal with his OCS. This is the first case to report the benefit of memantine in SGAs-associated OCS. It suggests that memantine is a worth considering approach, especially when the OCS are resistant to routine managements.

Most commonly observed in the Japanese population, elsewhere it is rare and associated with autoimmune diseases, plasma cell dyscrasias, or sulfhydryl group medications. The active metabolite of clopidogrel has a sulfhydryl group and here we report a case of clopidogrel-induced IAS. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old man was admitted with severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia requiring continuous intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose to sustain euglycemia. His symptoms of hypoglycemia had started after commencing dual antiplatelet therapy (including clopidogrel) for ischemic heart disease 9 months earlier. The hypoglycemia was associated with elevated insulin, proinsulin, c-peptide, and anti-insulin antibody titers as well as the HLA-DRB1*04 haplotype. Multiple localizing studies were negative for an insulinoma. A diagnosis of IAS was thus made. Clopidogrel cessation, oral dexamethasone, and diazoxide therapy were not sufficient to safely wean the dextrose infusion. Plasma exchange was ultimately effective.

32070198,,Advantages of everolimus therapeutic drug monitoring in oncology when drug-drug interaction is suspected: A case report.,Strobbe G||Pannier D||Sakji I||Villain A||Feutry F||Marliot G,"INTRODUCTION: Drug interactions involving everolimus are fairly well known because of its common use, primarily as an immunosuppressant. Several recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring are also available for the use of everolimus-based immunosuppression regimens. However, everolimus use in oncology differs substantially, particularly because of the high doses involved. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although sometimes necessary, is not recommended as a routine in oncology. Thus, it was deemed inapplicable due to the lack of clear recommendations. CASE REPORT: Here, we present a case where a patient was prescribed everolimus for renal cell carcinoma. The patient benefitted from a pharmaceutical consultation prior to treatment initiation, and a drug interaction with verapamil was suspected.Management and outcome: Therapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus was proposed. Based on the everolimus values reported in the literature, trough plasma concentration in the patient was greatly increased. The patient was then diagnosed with grade 4 oral mucositis, thereby requiring temporary suspension of everolimus treatment. Management of adverse effects was performed through multiple medicated mouthwashes. DISCUSSION: Therapeutic drug monitoring for everolimus is important for potential drug interactions or the occurrence of severe adverse events. In such cases, dose adjustments should be managed according to everolimus plasma concentrations. Clear oncological recommendations regarding plasma everolimus thresholds are required for a successful follow-up of the patient's condition and to ensure adequate response to treatment.",2020 Oct,20200218.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the therapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus in oncology and its potential drug interactions, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the therapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus in oncology and its potential drug interactions, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Molecular analysis showed anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement and alectinib was started. Six months into therapy, he presented with hematochezia, nausea, and epigastric pain and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Triglyceride level resulted above the measurable level at >5680mg/dL, thought to be the inciting event of pancreatitis.Management and outcome: Despite treatment with intravenous hydration, insulin infusion, and antibiotics, he decompensated with development of respiratory failure, shock requiring intensive care. Therapeutic plasmapheresis was initiated due to persistently elevated triglyceride. Following the third plasmapheresis, triglyceride level decreased to 359 mg/dL. With aggressive multidisciplinary management, he made a complete recovery. Follow-up imaging studies at three and six months show a stable mass-like abnormality in the right hilum without evidence of disease progression. DISCUSSION: Prior to starting alectinib, our patient's triglyceride level was 420 mg/dL. While he consumed alcohol, he had no other traditional risk factor. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis related to treatment with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor.",2020 Sep,20200213.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis related to alectinib, which is not relevant to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis related to alectinib, which is not relevant to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

METHODS: All patients with a full-thickness MH with a minimum diameter of <600 microm and a base diameter of <1,200 microm underwent pars plana vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peeling with autologous blood covering the MH at the end of the surgery. No fluid-air exchange or gas tamponade was performed. Postoperatively, all patients were instructed to adopt supine position overnight and thereafter any comfortable posture. RESULTS: A total of 18 eyes of 18 consecutive patients were included. The mean age of the patients (12 women and 6 men) was 59.06 +/- 14.31 years (range, 21-81 years). The MHs composed of 13 idiopathic MHs, 2 MHs with high myopia (axial length > 26.5 mm), 2 traumatic MHs, and 1 MH associated with diabetic macular edema. Among them were five large MHs (minimum diameter > 400 microm). Complete MH closure was achieved in all eyes at the end of the follow-up period (range, 3-14 months). Visual acuity was significantly improved from preoperative 0.89 +/- 0.41 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (20/155 Snellen) to 0.42 +/- 0.33 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (20/53 Snellen) at the final visit (P < 0.001).

Furthermore, little has been reported on thiamine deficiency (TD) in patients receiving nivolumab treatment. METHOD: From a series of cancer patients, we reported a patient with recurrent renal cell carcinoma who developed TD after the start of nivolumab treatment. RESULTS: A 74-year-old man with recurrent renal cell carcinoma was referred to the psycho-oncology department as he had lost about 4 kg and displayed a loss of energy after four cycles of nivolumab treatment. Psychiatric interviews revealed a decrease in energy. Neurological examination did not reveal any impairment in consciousness, ataxia, or ocular symptoms. He did not develop appetite loss. The malabsorption or overconsumption of some nutrients is thought to occur due to the rapid loss of weight; thus, a reduction in vitamin B1, which has a short storage period in the body and is often deficient in cancer patients, was suspected. The diagnosis of TD was supported by the patient's abnormally low serum thiamine level.

CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old man with 30 pack-year smoking history and schizoaffective disorder was found to have multiple right-sided lung nodules after presenting with atypical chest pain. Staging CT showed bilateral adrenal masses and a large soft tissue mass in the right iliac fossa. Tissue pathology and immunohistochemical staining was consistent with PUC. As the patient was cisplatin-ineligible due to poor performance status and multiple medical comorbidities, the decision was made to treat with pembrolizumab. Repeat CT chest and abdomen showed partial response at three months and stable disease at six months. DISCUSSION: The KEYNOTE-052 study found that first-line pembrolizumab in cisplatin-ineligible patients with urothelial cancer resulted in complete or partial response in 24% of patients with few adverse effects. However, it is unclear if patients with plasmacytoid variant were included. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with metastatic PUC not only treated with pembrolizumab but shown to have clinical response. CONCLUSION: Given our patient's clinical response, pembrolizumab is a promising first-line agent for treating cisplatin-ineligible patients with metastatic PUC. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm the benefit of treating this patient population with pembrolizumab.",2020 Jan,20190304.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the treatment of urothelial cancer and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the treatment of urothelial cancer and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case report of pembrolizumab treatment in a patient with plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case report of pembrolizumab treatment in a patient with plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

HCQ is generally safe and may be prescribed to pregnant women. Although current guidelines recommend initiating HCQ when considering pregnancy, the drug can cause adverse effects such as acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), which should be carefully evaluated. A 30-year-old pregnant woman with systemic lupus erythematosus at 16 + 5 gestational weeks was referred to National Center for Child Health and Development for persistent proteinuria and alopecia. Tacrolimus was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. At 20 + 3 weeks of gestation, HCQ was administered to allow for a dose reduction of prednisolone. Proteinuria gradually improved as the pregnancy course stabilised. At 27 + 1 weeks of gestation, generalised pustular exanthema developed, presumably due to HCQ. Based on the clinical course and the analysis of the skin lesions, she was diagnosed to have either AGEP or generalised pustular psoriasis. Despite discontinuing HCQ, the skin lesions worsened dramatically, and infliximab therapy was required. After one course of infliximab treatment, exanthema gradually subsided. The final diagnosis was AGEP, based on the clinical course and pathological findings. At 30 weeks, pyothorax developed because of the pyogenic skin lesion and the compromised immune system, and long-term antibiotic therapy was required until 32 + 4 weeks, after which she underwent caesarean section. Although introducing HCQ is occasionally necessary during pregnancy, it is preferable to initiate HCQ in the preconception period and not after pregnancy because of the possible adverse effect, which can alter perinatal prognosis.

Notably, the malignant transformation rate of oral leukoplakia with concomitant oral submucous fibrosis is significantly higher than that of oral submucous fibrosis or oral leukoplakia alone. However, the management of these conditions is not well defined. Photodynamic therapy is a minimally invasive treatment modality that effectively targets oral potentially malignant disorders, such as oral leukoplakia, erythroleucoplakia, and verrucous hyperplasia, with the advantages of being repeatable and leaving no scarring. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 42-year-old man with concomitant oral leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis almost involving the entire right buccal mucosa, who underwent six sessions of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy. RESULTS: Photodynamic therapy successfully eradicated whitish plaques and improved mouth opening without any adverse effects. Although photodynamic therapy failed to completely reverse the pathological changes, grading of epithelial dysplasia did not progress and clinical recurrence was not found during the 10-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy appears safe and has excellent clinical efficacy against oral leukoplakia-concomitant oral submucous fibrosis, but long-term follow-up is necessary.",2023 Mar,20221116.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of photodynamic therapy for oral leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of photodynamic therapy for oral leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis, and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

A Case Report.,Al-Thahir AS||Al-Yami AA||Saeed E||Zahid R||Al-Bahili HM||Theodoropoulos I,"BACKGROUND Delayed graft function (DGF) is defined as failure of the transplanted kidney to function in the early -post-transplant period. DGF is a rare complication after living donor kidney transplant and is most common after deceased donor kidney transplant, probably due to prolonged warm and cold ischemia times during retrieval. Most cases of DGF resolve spontaneously within days to weeks. There are very few reported cases in the literature of DGF lasting over 4 weeks. We present a case that resolved after 55 days. The recipient subsequently achieved normal renal function. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 52-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who underwent a second living donor renal transplant. The donor was his son, with whom he had 1 antigen mismatch. Postoperative day 1, the patient developed anuria and failed to improve with fluids and diuretics. Investigations ruled out common causes of renal dysfunction (rejection, ischemia), but failed to disclose the cause of this condition. After an extended period of watchful waiting, the graft function returned, reaching normal creatinine and urine output levels. CONCLUSIONS DGF after living donor kidney transplantation is rare, and few cases lasting more than a month have been reported. Before diagnosing DGF, other causes of renal dysfunction (rejection, ischemia, medication adverse effects) must be ruled out. In the absence of these, expectant management is appropriate and full graft recovery can be expected, even with anuria and hemodialysis.",2022 Nov 14,20221114.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on delayed graft function after kidney transplant, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on delayed graft function after kidney transplant, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses delayed graft function in kidney transplantation, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses delayed graft function in kidney transplantation, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

They are available to be purchased from gas stations marketed as ""nail polish remover not for human consumption"". These rapid-onset, short-acting, vasodilators cause the user to experience euphoria, dizziness, tachycardia and flushing. While chronic use may lead to problems such as methemoglobinemia or neuropathy, nitrites rarely lead to acute life-threatening side effects such as ventricular dysrhythmias. CASE REPORT: We report a case of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in a 21-year-old male after inhaling from a solution labeled to contain isobutyl nitrite, a rarely reported adverse effect of ""popper"" use. The product was analytically confirmed to contain mainly isobutyl alcohol, volatile hydrocarbons, and isobutyl nitrite, as well as smaller quantities of other substances. The patient was also prescribed escitalopram and hydroxyzine may have contributed. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in the field after initiation of CPR and defibrillation.

The etiologic agents vary by age group. BM because of Group B streptococcus (GBS) is common for the neonatal period but considered as rare in adult patients. Acute BM can have various presentations and adverse effects, such as ischemic stroke in 10% to 29% of the cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a rare case of GBS meningitis presented with cerebral infarction (CI) in an adult patient and to make a brief review of the etiology and incidence of GBS infections in adults. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 62-year-old female who presented with acute onset of central lesion of the right facial nerve, mild hemiparesis on the right, and partial sensorimotor aphasia. There were no signs of meningoradicular irritation. The pupils were equal, with slow reaction to light, and unaffected eye movements. There was a central lesion of the right facial nerve and mild hemiparesis on the right. Tendon reflexes were unremarkable and Babinski's sign was negative bilaterally. DISCUSSION: This review shows an increasing incidence of cases in elderly patients. A higher risk of GBS is found in adults with more medical comorbidities. CI, as a rare adverse effect in BM, is both a sign for severity and a predictor of a poor clinical outcome with a high lethal rate. GBS infections are a growing problem in older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. The involvement of the central nervous system as meningitis is a less common manifestation with a high lethal rate. CONCLUSIONS: CI is a rare adverse effect of neuro infections leading to an even worse clinical outcome. Early recognition of the infection and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are the crucial moments of successful management of GBS disease.",2022 Sep-Oct,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.

This study aimed to determine the clinical effect of rPMS on hiccup alleviation. METHODS: Seven patients with idiopathic persistent hiccups experienced the cervical rPMS session (1 Hz, 656 stimuli) in this prospective clinical series from November 2018 to May 2021. The rPMS session was applied once daily until the hiccups were utterly relieved. During the treatment, the round coil was transversally positioned over the upper nape area, and the center of the coil was placed at the level of the C4 vertebrae. The subjective assessment scale (SAS) scores and the hiccup frequency were assessed before and after rPMS treatment. RESULTS: A total of 7 patients were enrolled. All were male post-stroke patients ([mean +/- SD] age, 58.5 +/- 9.85 years) with dysphasia, 3 patients (3/7) were fed with a nasogastric tube, and 4 patients (4/7) were with dysarthria. The mean duration of hiccups was 4.14 +/- 3.63 days (range 2-12 days). The rPMS therapy eliminated hiccups in all 7 patients. The mean sessions which stopped hiccupping were 3.43 +/- 2.57 (range 1-9). The mean value of the SAS scores before rPMS therapy was 7 +/- 1 (range 6-8), and it was decreased to zero after the therapy (0). No recurrence of hiccups was observed within 2 weeks of the last rPMS session. rPMS therapies were not associated with severe adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The cervical rPMS therapy is beneficial in treating idiopathic persistent hiccups, particularly in post-stroke patients.",2022 Oct 28,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effects of cervical repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on idiopathic persistent hiccups and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}",The article discusses the effects of cervical repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on idiopathic persistent hiccups and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,95,,
36253832,PMC9578242,Breastfeeding by a mother taking cyclosporine for nephrotic syndrome.,Li R||Zhang C||Wang H||An Y,"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine is widely used for immunosuppressive treatment of various systematic and local autoimmune diseases. Breastfeeding is conventionally contraindicated when treating with cyclosporine due to its excretion into breast milk, which may cause immune suppression of exposed infants and affect infants; growth. A few cases have tested cyclosporine levels in random breast milk samples and concluded the infants exposed to safe cyclosporine levels during breastfeeding. Since infants do not maintain a fixed feeding schedule, we monitored cyclosporine levels in breast milk at different times of the day to assess the safety of breast milk for infants throughout the day. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old dichorionic twin-pregnancy woman had nephrotic syndrome with renal biopsy confirmed type V lupus nephritis for over five years. She was treated only with prednisone 10 mg a day before pregnancy and during early pregnancy. Cyclosporine was added in her regimen from 22 weeks gestation and was adjusted to 225 mg a day from 28 weeks gestation. After parturition, she partially breastfed her twin infants while being treated with cyclosporine 3 mg/kg a day as well as prednisone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The cyclosporine level in maternal blood was determined, and several breast milk samples were collected for consecutive 48 h beginning on the ninth day after parturition. The concentration of cyclosporine in breast milk was measured and ranged from 0.443 to 5.307 mcg/L. Both infants grew and developed normally at the three-month follow-up, with no adverse effects observed. The study was conducted at West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, started in September 2021, with the consent of the participant and the approval of the ethics committee. CONCLUSION: In this case, cyclosporine levels in breast milk were low at all times of the day. The growth and development of both infants were normal at three months postpartum.

However, immediate complications like voice hoarseness, cervical spine injury, and tooth trauma are common. One of the rarest complications is lingual nerve palsy. Risk factors include small airway instruments, non-supine position, nitrous oxide use, and difficult intubation. Only 15 cases of lingual nerve injury were identified worldwide, and only 2 of them were bilateral. This case report describes the third case of bilateral lingual nerve palsy after intubation. CASE REPORT We present a 52-year-old woman admitted for a total abdominal hysterectomy. Postoperatively, the patient noted voice hoarseness, left tongue numbness, and loss of taste on both sides of the tongue. MRI brain revealed no new masses or lesions, and a diagnosis of bilateral lingual nerve palsy was made. She was treated conservatively with symptom observation for 14 weeks. On follow-up, she remained with only a patch of numbness and dryness, and loss of taste on the top middle area of the tongue. CONCLUSIONS Lingual nerve palsy is a very rare but devastating adverse effect of airway manipulation. Symptoms can include dryness, loss of sensation, and loss of taste of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue on the ipsilateral side.

Evidence-based therapeutic interventions to treat post-COVID-19 symptoms (also called ""Long-COVID symptoms"") have not yet been established, and the treating physicians must rely on conjecture to help patients. Based on its mechanism of action and its efficacy in treating cognitive impairment, as well as its good tolerability, the Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 has been suggested as a remedy to alleviate cognitive post-COVID-19 symptoms. In many studies, EGb 761 has been demonstrated to protect endothelial cells, to have potent anti-inflammatory effects, and to enhance neuroplasticity. CASE REPORT Here, we report for the first time the application of EGb 761 in the therapy of post-COVID-19-related cognitive deficits. Three women and 2 men, aged 26 to 59 years (average age 34.6 years), presented with concentration and attention deficits, cognitive deficiencies, and/or fatigue 9-35 weeks after infection. A daily dose of 2x80 mg of EGb 761 did not cause any detectable adverse effects, and it substantially improved or completely restored cognitive deficits and, when initially present, also other symptoms, such as fatigue and hyposmia, within an observation period of up to 6 months.

METHODS: We present two cases of men that developed an ischemic priapism after the intake of tamsulosin prescribed for STUI and were treated in our hospital. We described the two cases, from the diagnosis until the surgery that was performed. Also, we review the scientific literature about this topic. RESULTS: In one hand, a 67 years old man with the previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia that take a one single dosis of tamsulosin and developed a priapism of 9 hours of duration. He was diagnosticated of low-flow priapism that was reverted after the use of intracavernosal phenylephrine. On the other hand, a 61 years old man without any medical condition. He developed a priapism after the intake of also one single dosis of tamsulosin and came to the hospital after 48 hours of the beginning of the erection. In this case, the use of intracavernosal phenylephrine wasn t effective so we decided to performed a distal shunt between cavernosal and spongy body according to the techniques of Winter, Ebbehoj and Al-Ghorab. All of them without results. At the end, we tried a proximal shunt according Quackles technique, also ineffective.

Summary: A 62-year-old female presented to our institution's emergency department (ED) with symptoms consistent with Clostridioides difficile infection. The patient was prescribed 2 weeks of oral vancomycin for CDI prior to presentation. Given insufficient response to vancomycin, the patient was started on fidaxomicin with a planned 10-day course. After 2 doses of fidaxomicin, the patient developed a rash on her back that spread within 24 hours. The patient did not experience relief upon administration of a variety of medications for allergic reaction. Improvement was noted upon discontinuation of fidaxomicin. The Food and Drug Administration reports that < 2% of adults treated with fidaxomicin experience a rash as an adverse effect.

36085017,PMC9463818,Double trouble - management of perinephric hematoma and renal vein thrombosis post percutaneous renal biopsy.,Kamarudin MI||Nadarajan C||Daud MAM,"BACKGROUND: Performing percutaneous renal biopsy procedures in lupus nephritis (LN) and nephrotic syndrome presents a unique challenge to the nephrologist because of the risk of bleeding from the procedure and the hypercoagulable state in hypoalbuminemia. The management of a patient with venous thrombosis with perinephric hematoma post renal biopsy can be difficult if occurred. CASE PRESENTATION: We are presenting a case of perinephric hematoma following percutaneous renal biopsy in a 23-year-old man with lupus nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and lower limbs deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient developed persistent frank haematuria, flank pain and acute urinary retention post-procedure. We have withheld his oral warfarin three days before the procedure, and no anticoagulation was given subsequently. Initial CT Angiography (CTA) renal showing stable hematoma and no visible evidence of vascular injury. Three weeks later, the patient still has persistent frank haematuria and a repeated CTA renal revealed new bilateral renal vein thrombosis. Considering the high risk of worsening symptomatic venous thrombosis, we gave subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium and restart oral warfarin despite ongoing haematuria. The frank haematuria resolved within two days of anticoagulation with no radiological evidence of worsening of the perinephric hematoma. The follow-up ultrasonography a month later showed resolution of the hematoma and renal vein thrombosis with no adverse effect. CONCLUSION: Our experience, in this case, highlighted the importance of case selection for percutaneous renal biopsy among high-risk patients. Additionally, a prolonged frank haematuria in post-renal biopsy with nephrotic syndrome warranted a reassessment, as a clinical presentation of post-procedure perinephric hematoma and renal vein thrombosis can overlap. We also demonstrated that restarting anticoagulation earlier than four weeks in a patient with renal vein thrombosis and post-renal biopsy perinephric hematoma can be safe in the selective case.",2022 Sep 9,20220909.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on the complications of a percutaneous renal biopsy.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; it focuses on the complications of a percutaneous renal biopsy.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to a percutaneous renal biopsy, specifically perinephric hematoma and renal vein thrombosis, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to a percutaneous renal biopsy, specifically perinephric hematoma and renal vein thrombosis, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
36075189,,The Safety and Efficacy of Clonidine in Hemodialysis Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Derk G||Barton A||An R||Fang HY||Ashrafi SA||Wilund K,"BACKGROUND: Clonidine is a frequently prescribed long-term antihypertensive medication in hemodialysis (HD) patients in the USA, but its safety and efficacy has not been clearly established in the HD population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety and efficacy of clonidine in HD patients. METHODS: Keyword search of ""clonidine"" and ""dialysis"" was conducted through April 2021 in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Inclusion criteria were as follows - study design: randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, prospective studies, retrospective studies, or case series; subjects: adult HD patients; main outcome: blood pressure (BP) and safety; language: English; and article type: peer-reviewed publications. Studies that examined the effects of clonidine in populations other than adult HD patients were excluded. Meta-analysis was performed on BP reduction outcomes. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, including prospective pre-post studies (2), double-blind controlled trial (1), single-blinded placebo-controlled trial (1), crossover open-label clinical trial (1), retrospective analysis (1), and case report series (2). Three studies included in the meta-analysis ranged from 2 to 12 weeks duration, with a collective sample size of 24 (ages 12-77 years). Risk of bias, assessed using the ROBINS-1 tool, was high for all included studies. Significant adverse effects reported included hypotension, light-headedness, drowsiness, dry mouth, rebound hypertension, and contact dermatitis from patch application. Short-term clonidine use was associated with significant improvement in systolic BP (pooled effect: -12.985 mm Hg, 95% CI [-7.878, -18.092], p < 0.001), while changes in diastolic BP were not statistically significant (-11.119 mm Hg, 95% CI [-22.725, 0.487], p = 0.060). No data currently support the long-term efficacy of clonidine in HD patients. This study was unfunded and was developed using PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018112042). CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence supporting the long-term use of clonidine in the HD population and a significant side-effect profile. There is low-quality evidence demonstrating the efficacy of clonidine in lowering BP in HD patients in short-term use, but significant safety concerns remain. Fluid removal strategies and other antihypertensives should be used over clonidine for long-term BP control in the HD population.",2022,20220908.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the safety and efficacy of clonidine in hemodialysis patients, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the safety and efficacy of clonidine in hemodialysis patients, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

International guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with NS and high risk of TE, but no studies have identified the optimal type of anticoagulation in NS. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) by analyzing the thromboembolic and bleeding events in NS patients prescribed DOAC as primary prophylaxis to prevent TE or as treatment for TE occurring in relation to NS. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective study including patients with NS, a plasma albumin less than 25 g/L and prophylactic anticoagulation treatment with DOAC at the Department of Renal Medicine at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from July 2016 to June 2021. Patients treated with DOAC as thromboprophylaxis for other indications than NS were excluded. Baseline characteristics and outcomes, including TE, bleeding and other adverse effects associated with DOAC were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: We identified 268 patients treated with DOAC of which 21 patients with NS were included in the study. Nineteen patients were prescribed DOAC as thromboprophylaxis and two patients received DOAC due to previous TE, which was considered associated with the NS. The type of DOAC prescribed was apixaban (n = 10) and rivaroxaban (n = 11). No patients experienced TE during DOAC treatment, while five patients had a minor bleeding episode. Patients who experienced bleeding episodes were older (median 62 vs 51 years), more often female (80%) and had been on DOAC for a longer period (204 days vs 47 days). Neither the HAS-BLED score nor GN-risk-score predicted the risk of minor bleedings in this population.

36052653,,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amiodarone in patients with hypertriglyceridemia: Two case reports.,Uno T||Sakakura K||Mukai Y||Takada M||Noda T||Kusano K||Hayakawa N,"BACKGROUND: The antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone has noncardiac adverse effects, leading to restrictive therapeutic plasma ranges. Despite the significant positive correlation between triglyceride and amiodarone levels, the effect of fluctuations in amiodarone levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia on amiodarone therapy has not been fully characterized. This study is the first to report on the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the efficacy and safety of amiodarone therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient was a 58-year-old man with hypertriglyceridemia who was diagnosed with ventricular fibrillation (patient #1). The second patient with hypertriglyceridemia was a 72-year-old man with sustained ventricular tachycardia (patient #2). Both patients received implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. During the study period, amiodarone and N-desethylamiodarone concentrations were measured 12 times in patient #1 and 26 times in patient #2. Triglyceride concentrations in patient #1 and patient #2 ranged from 102 to 765 mg/dL and from 125 to 752 mg/dL, respectively. For both patients, amiodarone dosage was maintained at 100 mg/day, and the administration of concomitant drugs that could affect amiodarone pharmacokinetics was neither initiated nor discontinued. However, amiodarone concentrations fluctuated (patient #1, 0.52 - 1.86 mug/mL; patient #2, 0.73 - 2.82 mug/mL). Although amiodarone concentrations fluctuated, neither of the patients had defibrillation shocks to stop the abnormal rhythm via an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and laboratory data showed that thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, KL-6, and surfactant protein-D remained close to normal. CONCLUSION: In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, it may be necessary for clinicians to pay more attention to the clinical symptoms along with fluctuations in amiodarone levels and accordingly adjust amiodarone dosage.",2022 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amiodarone in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amiodarone in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,
36038995,,Olanzapine-Induced Elevated Liver Function Tests in an Older Person Treated for Antidepressant-Induced Mania.,Reid NK||Alam E||Moke M||Woessner R||Crouse EL,"Patient History A 67-year-old male presented with symptoms of mania eight days after switching from sertraline to bupropion. His past medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, insomnia, and a recent diagnosis of depression. He denied previous history of depression but reported taking sertraline for premature ejaculation, an off-label use. His baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 20 U/L and alanine transaminase (ALT) was 22 U/L. Bupropion was held on admission and olanzapine 5 mg nightly was initiated to treat mania. Following six days of olanzapine treatment, his liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated (AST = 83 U/L, ALT = 105 U/L) and peaked two days later at AST being 2,024 U/L and ALT being 1,508 U/L. Other causes of LFT elevation were ruled out since no other new medications were started and the patient denied use of acetaminophen. Olanzapine was subsequently discontinued and his LFTs began to improve. His symptoms of mania resolved, and he was discharged on no psychotropic medications. Review of Literature A literature search identified 6 cases of bupropion-induced mania/hypomania and 10 cases of olanzapine-induced increased LFTs. This case will add to the limited reports regarding these adverse effects. Conclusion Possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed between the initiation of bupropion and the development of manic symptoms as well as the initiation of olanzapine and elevated LFTs.

35940982,,Acute Renal Insufficiency Associated With Consumption of Hydrocodone- and Morphine-Adulterated Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa).,LeSaint KT||Yin S||Sharma A||Avery BA||McCurdy CR||Waksman JC,"BACKGROUND: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), an evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, contains alkaloids that cause both stimulant and opioid-like effects. In the United States, its use continues to grow. Kratom products, however, are unregulated and nonstandardized, and reports of adulteration have been described previously. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old African-American woman with a history of occasional headaches and self-treatment with internet-purchased kratom presented to the emergency department with the chief symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and left flank pain. Laboratory tests showed a markedly elevated serum creatinine of 4.25 mg/dL (reference range 0.6-1.2 mg/dL) and proteinuria. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was unrevealing. A standard urine screen for drugs of abuse was positive for opiates. A confirmatory testing revealed the presence of hydrocodone and morphine in the urine. Hydrocodone, morphine, and mitragynine were identified in a sample of kratom leaves provided by the patient. The patient's renal function improved with supportive care and normalized 1 month post discharge after kratom discontinuation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Despite widespread use, relatively little is known about kratom's adverse effects, particularly regarding its potential to cause renal insufficiency. This case illustrates the vital importance of recognizing that adulteration of unregulated products is certainly a possibility and clinicians may continue to see a rise in adverse effects, given kratom's increasing popularity.",2022 Jul,20220806.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to kratom use, specifically acute renal insufficiency, rather than complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to kratom use, specifically acute renal insufficiency, rather than complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.",2,90,,

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important because PJP is a potentially life-threatening infection. However, the diagnosis of PJP in the early stage can be challenging due to various factors. Furthermore, the early presentation of PJP, which includes normal chest radiograph and examination findings along with the subacute presentation of PJP in patients with HIV, makes an early diagnosis of the disease even more challenging for doctors. CASE REPORT In this case report, we present the case of a 39-year-old man who had normal chest X-ray findings during the initial stage of his presentation. Coupled with non-disclosure of HIV status, these led to a delay in PJP diagnosis. The diagnosis of PJP with underlying HIV was later supported by the patient's clinical features, initial blood investigations, and presence of high-risk sexual activity. The diagnosis was confirmed when the PJP polymerase chain reaction test from the respiratory sample was positive. He was successfully treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, he subsequently developed rare adverse effects of drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, which was diagnosed based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and recent exposure to a new drug. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was promptly discontinued, which resulted in symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS This case report aims to create awareness among primary care doctors to be vigilant of the PJP diagnosis and its nonspecific presentations as well as to the rare adverse effects of medications to treat PJP.",2022 Jul 26,20220726.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Due to their lack of tissue specificity, these drugs can lead to undesirable side effects at off-target sites and may be potentiated by supplements that impact the half-life of these drugs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Caucasian female with history of Sjogren's syndrome, who was being managed with cevimeline, presented to the primary care office with reported hyperhidrosis, malaise, nausea, and tachycardia.

Electrocardiogram showed no acute ST-T changes. Clinical improvement occurred with hydration and discontinuation of the supplement. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, there has only been one other documented cevimeline overdose, and it was not associated with an herbal supplementation interaction. Physicians should actively elicit herbal supplement information from patients to anticipate possible drug-herb interactions.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) induced by typical antipsychotics can be exacerbated by other D2 receptor antagonists. We describe a case of persistent EPS induced by long-term, intermittent administration of low-dose olanzapine along with metoclopramide for emesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old pancreatic cancer patient underwent chemotherapy for 7 months. He was referred to the psychiatry department because of restlessness and insomnia. Although he did not have obvious depressive symptoms, he was anxious about the cancer treatment. For chemotherapy-induced nausea, he had been prescribed 5 mg of olanzapine intermittently for 7 months. He had last used the drug 9 days before presenting it to us. Additionally, he received metoclopramide and palonosetron as antiemetics. We considered akathisia and cancer-related anxiety/agitation as possible causes of restlessness and insomnia, and prescribed clonazepam. However, his symptoms worsened, resulting in hospitalization. We reconsidered his symptoms as cancer-related anxiety/agitation and prescribed quetiapine. Although it was effective, he had tremors and was assessed by a neurologist. Considering the clinical manifestations of rigidity, postural reflex disorder, and a mask-like face, we suspected drug-induced parkinsonism and replaced quetiapine with biperiden on the next day, leading to his discharge after 2 weeks. He did not have symptom recurrence even after discontinuation of biperiden. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term, intermittent administration of low-dose antipsychotics with other antiemetics having D2 receptor antagonism can cause prolonged EPS.

35709347,,Pembrolizumab Induced Acute Kidney Injury and Liver Injury in a Patient with Malignant Melanoma.,DeVries JD||Huber M||Sulaiman R||Singal AK,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently gained recognition as valuable treatment options for a variety of cancers. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that acts as an inhibitor of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1). This helps release host T-cells from regulatory inhibition by tumor neoantigens, therefore mediating antitumor effects. Pembrolizumab has been approved for a variety of cancers including melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and urothelial cell carcinoma. It has also recently gained attention for possible use in hepatocellular carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer. Although efficacious, ICIs manifest a unique set of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) including acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute liver injury (ALI) of which the mechanism is poorly understood. While these irAEs have been described previously in literature individually, there is a paucity of literature describing their simultaneous occurence.

35649436,,Localized CO(2) laser treatment of a recalcitrant oral ulceration in pemphigus vulgaris.,Chainani-Wu N||Gopal-Murthy V||Wu A||Marinkovich MP,"INTRODUCTION: Recalcitrant oral lesions of pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an autoimmune blistering disease, can result in significant discomfort, difficulty in eating, and maintaining oral hygiene. Increasing the dosage of systemic medications to control such localized lesions results in an increased risk of adverse effects. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a male patient diagnosed at age 51 with PV by oral biopsy that included a direct immunofluorescence examination. After further baseline laboratory testing, he was started on prednisone and mycophenolate. These medications were slowly tapered with adjustments guided by clinical signs. Mycophenolate was replaced with intravenous immunoglobulin monthly infusions due to adverse effects about 2 years after initiation. During the 4.5-year follow-up period after diagnosis, his oral and skin lesions were well-controlled apart from minor transient flares. However, a painful ulcerated lesion on the facial gingiva between #11 and 12 was nonresponsive, even with the use of topical clobetasol in trays. A carbon dioxide (CO(2) ) laser was used to vaporize the recalcitrant lesion under local anesthesia. The procedure resulted in complete healing of ulceration with no recurrence until the most recent examination, 2 years postlaser surgery. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive procedures that can facilitate a decrease in the cumulative dosage of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have great value in the management of PV. CO(2) laser vaporization is safe, with minimal morbidity and no long-term side effects. It should be considered an adjunctive treatment option for the management of recalcitrant lesions in patients with oral PV. KEY POINTS: Why is this case new information? To our knowledge, this is the second report on the use of a CO(2) laser in the treatment of recalcitrant oral lesions of PV and the first report with a documented long-term resolution of the treated lesions. What are the keys to the successful management of this case? A localized recalcitrant lesion was treated with this approach. All other mucosal and cutaneous sites were well controlled on the patient's systemic medication regimen. What are the primary limitations to success in this case? This approach is only relevant for the management of recalcitrant lesions in patients whose disease activity is otherwise well controlled.

35642551,PMC9131439,Cyclosporine A-Induced Conchal Hyperplasia with Nasal Obstruction in a Patient with Membranous Nephropathy.,Tillmann FP||Harth A||Ozcan F||Jorres A,"BACKGROUND The immunomodulatory and pharmacokinetic effects of cyclosporine A are used to treat diverse disease entities in different medical fields, including organ transplantation and/or autoimmune diseases. It is also applied in patients with nephrotic range proteinuria as an adjunct to steroids and supportive antihypertensive/antiproteinuric medications. Cyclosporine has a small therapeutic window and is dosed with respect to the underlying disease entity and severity via trough level adaptations. Among its most frequent adverse effects are hypertension, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and electrolyte disturbances. Hypertrichosis and gingival hyperplasia are obvious and widely recognized adverse effects. CASE REPORT We report on a 66-year-old woman who was treated with cyclosporine A for primary membranous nephropathy. During treatment with cyclosporine, she developed hirsutism and gingival hyperplasia. Later, she reported having impaired nasal breathing and dyspnea on mild physical exercise. Clinical, rhinoscopic, and radiological evaluations showed marked conchal hyperplasia as a potential cause of her symptoms. An extensive medical work-up did not show evidence of allergic, immunologic, or other drug adverse effects, suggesting cyclosporine-induced hyperplasia of the turbinates as a hypothetical causative factor. Dose reductions did not lead to resolution of symptoms but resulted in increasing proteinuria. Therefore, cyclosporine was stopped, and the patient was treated with rituximab. Thereafter, hirsutism and gingival and conchal hyperplasia gradually regressed over 2-4 months, showing complete resolution of conchal hyperplasia on computed-tomography follow-up after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Cyclosporine can not only result in gingival hyperplasia but also in hyperplasia of the turbinates leading to impaired nasal breathing and shortness of breath on exertion. An extensive search for many other known causes of conchal swelling is warranted to finally suggest an adverse effect of cyclosporine. Discontinuation of cyclosporine resulted in complete remission of conchal hyperplasia as well as other adverse effects.",2022 May 21,20220521.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the adverse effects of cyclosporine A.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the adverse effects of cyclosporine A.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of cyclosporine A, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of cyclosporine A, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.",2,95,,

A less common side effect of baclofen is transient alterations of consciousness, which can easily be confused for altered mental status secondary to orthostatic hypotension in SCI. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man with an acute SCI secondary to an aortic dissection was found to have episodes of confusion after titrating oral baclofen from 5 mg three times per day to 10 mg three times per day at an acute rehabilitation facility. Orthostatic hypotension was initially suspected as the cause of transient alterations of consciousness; however, he was never found to be hypotensive during these episodes. His confusion resolved several days after discontinuation of baclofen. DISCUSSION: Although, confusion and lightheadedness in SCI are commonly caused by orthostatic hypotension, it is important for physicians to be cognizant of baclofen's side effects, which increase in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI). If an adverse effect is suspected, baclofen should be tapered while remaining observant for signs of baclofen withdrawal, which can be life-threatening.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old Iranian man presented with a nodular patch of bulbar conjunctiva in the right eye, and 1+ vitritis. A nearly complete shallow serous retinal detachment, retinal folds, and multifocal yellow choroidal infiltrates were seen during a fundus examination of the right eye. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography revealed macular retinal folds and an uneven, undulating, ""seasick"" appearance of the choroidal surface with choriocapillaris compression, intraretinal and subretinal fluid, and clusters of optically dense material at the outer retinal level.

More recently, Corynebacterium striatum has been implicated in human infections, including respiratory infections, endocarditis, and bone and joint infections, particularly those involving hardware or implanted devices. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man presented for washout of his left total knee arthroplasty following a revision 20 days prior. The patient underwent debridement of his left total knee and revision of the left total femur arthroplasty. Daptomycin was initiated empirically due to a previous rash from vancomycin. Operative tissue cultures grew Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium striatum. Given concern for daptomycin resistance and the reliability of vancomycin susceptibility, daptomycin was discontinued and vancomycin initiated following a graded challenge. Within a few days, the patient developed a diffuse, blanching, erythematous, maculopapular rash and daptomycin was restarted. Over the next 72 h, his rash progressed and he met criteria for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Daptomycin was stopped and oral linezolid initiated; rash improved. C. striatum returned with susceptibility to gentamicin, linezolid, vancomycin and daptomycin. Due to concern for adverse effects on long-term linezolid, daptomycin was restarted and was tolerated for 20 days, at which point purulent drainage from incision increased. The patient underwent another arthroplasty revision and washout. Operative cultures from this surgery were again positive for C. striatum. Repeat C. striatum susceptibilities revealed resistance to daptomycin but retained susceptibility to linezolid. Daptomycin was again changed to linezolid. He completed six weeks of linezolid followed by linezolid 600 mg daily for suppression and ultimately opted for disarticulation. CONCLUSIONS: C. striatum has historically been regarded as a contaminant, particularly when grown in tissue culture in the setting of prosthetic joint infection. Based on the available literature and susceptibility patterns, the most appropriate first-line therapy is vancomycin or linezolid. Treatment with daptomycin should be avoided, even when isolates appear susceptible, due to the risk of development of high-level resistance (MIC > 256 microg/mL) and clinical failure.",2022 Mar 26,20220326.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

CASE REPORT: Intravenous (IV) dicycloplatin (DCP) sustained remission in an American bladder cancer patient for five years. A recurrent mass was observed in July 2021. The patient received DCP capsules for seven weeks with no significant side-effects. Complete blood count with differential and a basic metabolic panel showed no adverse effects of DCP capsules on the bone marrow, liver or renal parameters. Cystoscopy after oral DCP found no evident bladder tumors; cytology was negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma. CONCLUSION: In this patient, DCP-capsules appeared to be as effective as DCP-IV for achieving bladder cancer remission. Both forms of DCP chemotherapy are convenient, active against several cancer types, with decreased adverse effects compared to cisplatin. Both have been available for treating cancer patients in China. A USA clinical trial of DCP in bladder and other cancers appears warranted.",2022 Mar,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the use of dicycloplatin in a bladder cancer patient and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the use of dicycloplatin in a bladder cancer patient and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case report on the use of dicycloplatin chemotherapy for bladder cancer and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case report on the use of dicycloplatin chemotherapy for bladder cancer and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

It can result from lymphatic and/or venous obstruction due to disease and/or treatment related fibrosis. There is very limited data on the use of directly applied hypertonic packs for the relief of periorbital oedema. CASE: A 63 year old man with recurrent laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma developed functional blindness secondary to periorbital oedema in the setting of severe facial swelling. This was refractory to maximal facial lymphatic massage available in the community setting. POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION: Management dilemmas included what non-medical interventions may relieve his periorbital oedema and thereby restore his vision outside of daily lymphatic massage from a qualified physiotherapist. FORMULATION OF MANAGEMENT PLAN: The patient agreed to an initial dry hypertonic pack with a great functional improvement of his vision. He was taught how to do this so that he could repeat ad libitum. OUTCOME: The patient had previously expressed that his most distressing thought was the prospect of becoming functionally blind prior to dying. The provision of an easy additional therapy to relieve his visual obstruction provided him with much comfort. He passed away peacefully a few weeks later. LESSONS: The case demonstrates that application of a dry hypertonic pack can relieve periorbital oedema in the setting of facial oedema in cases which are refractory to the combination of self-massage, cold-compress application, and daily lymphatic massage by a certified physiotherapist.

Despite its effectiveness and few adverse effects, it is related to renal and bone toxicity. We described two cases of HIV-positive middle-aged women who had been using TDF for two and four years (cases 1 and 2, respectively) and were admitted to the emergency room. Case 1 presented with metabolic ileum and diffuse bone pain while case 2 presented with bilateral coxo-femoral pain after a fall from standing height. Both cases had similar laboratory tests: hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia and elevated plasma creatinine. In urinary exams, there was evidence of renal loss of electrolytes, justifying the serum alterations, in addition to glucosuria and proteinuria. The bone pain investigation identified bone fractures and reduced bone mineral density, together with increased levels of parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase and vitamin D deficiency. These two cases illustrate the spectrum of adverse renal and bone effects associated with TDF use. TDF was discontinued and treatment was focused on correcting the electrolyte disturbances and acidosis, in addition to controlling the bone disease through vitamin D and calcium supplementation. The renal changes found in both cases characterized the Fanconi's syndrome, and occurred due to TDF toxicity to proximal tubule cells mitochondria. Bone toxicity occurred due to direct interference of TDF in bone homeostasis, in addition to vitamin D deficiency and phosphaturia resulting from tubulopathy. During the follow-up, both cases evolved with chronic kidney disease and in one of them, the Fanconi's syndrome did not revert.

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy often causes adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and renal dysfunction, which may necessitate dose modification or treatment prolongation. Therefore, novel combination therapies are urgently needed to improve the efficacy and overcome drug toxicity in this setting. CASE REPORT A 77-year-old man with advanced esophageal cancer received cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On day 8 of administration, the patient had lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and nausea and became unconscious and developed severe hyponatremia. We diagnosed the patient with cisplatin-induced syndrome of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Subsequently, water restriction was started, and treatment with a salt-added diet and 3% hypertonic saline infusion was initiated. The hyponatremia improved and the patient was discharged on day 16 of administration. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued, and surgical treatment was performed. However, the tumor recurred and chemotherapy was required. The patient developed severe hyponatremia while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy; hence, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin therapy (FOLFOX) were administered as an alternative treatment. The patient completed the FOLFOX therapy without developing SIADH. CONCLUSIONS The cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy is currently the standard chemotherapy regimen for esophageal cancer. However, SIADH is a known adverse effect when using cisplatin. In patients with esophageal cancer, oxaliplatin appears to have a lower risk of SIADH than cisplatin, suggesting that oxaliplatin can be a therapeutic option for patients with esophageal cancer who are at high risk of SIADH.",2022 Feb 15,20220215.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

35121723,PMC8826114,Severe Postoperative Bleeding Following Minor-to-Moderate Abdominal and Flank Liposuction Performed at a Day Surgery Center: A Case Report.,Berger O||Cherniavsky E||Talisman R,"BACKGROUND Liposuction is a one of the most common aesthetic procedures. The super-wet and tumescent techniques are used most frequently. Both serve to reduce collateral blood loss, facilitate the suctioning procedure, and providing local anesthesia. Overall, liposuction is considered safe and effective, with minor adverse effects such as swelling, minute bleeding, contour irregularities, and seroma. Serious complication such as life-threatening bleeding are rare. In this case report, we present a patient with significant postoperative bleeding following minor-to-moderate liposuction performed at a day surgery center. CASE REPORT A 51-year-old healthy man, 4 days after 1600-cc aspirate tumescent liposuction performed in a day surgery center, was admitted to our ward with tachycardia, weakness, abdominal pain and disseminated hematoma. On admission, laboratory testing showed hematocrit of 20.9% and hemoglobin of 6.9 gr/dl. Immediate abdominal CT angiography was performed to exclude active bleeding, showing diffused hematoma in the subcutaneous fat all over the abdomen and scrotum, with some edema without active bleeding. The patient was treated with blood transfusion to facilitate fast home discharge during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic that time. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the common work-up and treatment of postoperative hemorrhage. Blood transfusion following minor-to-moderate liposuction is unusual but during the COVID-19 pandemic it can facilitate quick discharge of a patient with postoperative hemorrhage with no active bleeding. Improper patient selection, an inexperienced surgeon, and inadequate operating locale can all result in postoperative complications.

Brentuximab vedotin (BV) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor are two ideal drugs used for the treatment of classic Hodgkin lymphoma, but few studies have reported their adverse effects in association with TFR. The efficacy and safety of monotherapy or combination therapy with these drugs needs to be further evaluated. It is essential to determine whether treated patients can develop TFR, thus enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old female patient, diagnosed with classic Hodgkin lymphoma, had received 2 + 3 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy (a combination of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and 4 cycles of PD-1 inhibitor (tislelizumab) therapy but exhibited poor efficacy. Subsequently, she was given combination therapy of BV (100 mg) + tislelizumab (200 mg). However, a slight fever, painful and swollen axillary lymph nodes, multiple skin rashes with pruritus, joint pain, and fatigue with poor appetite appeared during the treatment. Ultrasound (US) scans revealed that multiple lymph nodes were significantly enlarged. After treatment with low-dose dexamethasone and cetirizine, the symptoms were alleviated. A biopsy of the left axillary lymph node revealed that lymphoid tissue exhibited proliferative changes, without tumor cell infiltration. These findings were consistent with the clinical and pathological manifestations of TFR. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with BV and PD-1 inhibitor was effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The results suggest that the combination therapy may cause TFR, and biopsy and also continuous imaging observation are important to determine the disease stage. This approach allows clinicians to decide whether to continue the current treatment plan, and alerts them to the occurrence of excessive activation of the immune system.",2021,20220114.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on tumor flare reaction in a Hodgkin Lymphoma patient treated with immunotherapy.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on tumor flare reaction in a Hodgkin Lymphoma patient treated with immunotherapy.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses tumor flare reaction in a Hodgkin lymphoma patient treated with specific cancer therapies, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses tumor flare reaction in a Hodgkin lymphoma patient treated with specific cancer therapies, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Mitotane, a derivative of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, has been used successfully as first line chemotherapy since the 1960s, if maintained within a narrow therapeutic window. Spironolactone (SPL) is frequently used to treat glucocorticoid excess-associated adverse effects such as severe hypokalemia. Although data of a previous case report indicate a link, valid data regarding SPL use and mitotane plasma concentrations in a human cohort are lacking.This retrospective analysis includes data from 54 mitotane-receiving ACC patients (14 co-administered with SPL) treated between January 2005 and April 2020 (20 male, mean age 54.1 +/- 2.2 years). All available mitotane concentrations, treatment doses, tumor stage and evidence of hormone activity were collected. Primary outcomes included mitotane levels and concentration/dose ratios as well as time-in-range (TR) in patients with and without additional SPL treatment. The SPL group was characterized by higher glucocorticoid secretion. Other features such as tumor stage, size and anthropometrics were similar between groups. Interestingly, the SPL group had significantly lower mitotane levels despite higher doses. Mitotane TR was significantly reduced in the SPL group, as was time-in-range to progression.

34988953,,Cefepime Induced Neurotoxicity Mimicking Clinical Presentation of Left Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction: A Case Report and Review of Literature.,Su CY||Lin WH,"PURPOSE: Cefepime is a widely used antibiotic which was known to have neurotoxicity resulted from its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and a wide variety of symptoms had been documented. Here we reported a case of Cefepime induced neurotoxicity with rare presentation. The aim of this study was to improve the knowledge of this condition. CASE REPORT: A 89-year-old female with a history of ESRD (end stage renal disease) and superimposed acute cholecystitis was treated with Cefepime. She developed the symptoms of global aphasia, right hemiplegia, leftward eye deviation and abnormal plantar reflex at right foot, which resembled acute ischemic stroke at left MCA (middle cerebral artery), on the fourth day of Cefepime treatment. There was no evidence of acute infarction in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain and EEG (electroencephalography) revealed NCSE (nonconvulsive status epilepticus). NCSE was suspected to be attributed to Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity. The patient's main risk factors were decreased renal clearance and incorrect dosing. Conslusion: Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity should be suspected in patients who developed neurologic symptoms after the administration of Cefepime. Emergent image study for excluding more commonly seen or critical etiologies and further evaluation with EEG were necessary. For those patients who have risk factors for Cefepime neurotoxicity, such as ESRD, TDM (therapeutic drug monitoring) may be useful in providing close monitoring and preventing adverse effects associated with Cefepime treatment.

Symptoms and manifestations of chronic GVHD are heterogeneous and pleomorphic, and there are no standard treatments beyond corticosteroids. Therapy is typically prolonged, and chronic GVHD and its treatment are associated with adverse effects that have a significant impact on long-term quality of life and functional status. Several advances have been made over the last 2 decades to define the diagnosis of chronic GVHD as well as its severity and response criteria for clinical trials. Further understanding into the biologic mechanisms of the development of chronic GVHD has led to the investigation of several novel immunomodulatory and targeted therapies. Multi-institutional collaboration and pharmaceutical support in the development of therapies based on sound biologic mechanisms and clinical trials with defined end points and responses have led to several promising agents on the horizon of approval for treatment of chronic GVHD.

However, high-grade, potentially life-threatening adverse events are increasing. While case reports regarding immunotherapy-related bullous pemphigoid (BP) have been rising, only 1 has described BP following concomitant use of both nivolumab and radiation therapy (RT). For that patient, nivolumab was used for 10 weeks prior to RT and development of PB followed 7 weeks later. This case presents a patient who tolerated nivolumab well for 38 months prior to developing BP less than 2 weeks after completing RT. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of DH, a 67-year-old gentleman on nivolumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lung since May of 2017. Following progressing lung nodules, the patient had his nivolumab paused and completed a course of short-beam radiation therapy. After restarting nivolumab post-radiation, the patient presented with itchy rash and blisters on his arm, legs, and trunk. DIAGNOSIS: DH consulted dermatology following development of rash and was diagnosed with bullous dermatosis, likely bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid following concomitant nivolumab (OPDIVO), despite prior tolerance and no history of autoimmune disease, was confirmed by biopsy a month later. INTERVENTIONS: Initial treatment was betamethasone 0.05% cream mixed 1:1 with powder to form paste applied twice daily. Given progressive symptoms and confirmatory biopsy of BP, nivolumab was held and 100 mg doxycycline and 80 mg prednisone daily was prescribed for a week, reduced to 60 mg during the second week. OUTCOMES: A week following discontinuation of nivolumab and beginning of doxycycline and prednisone, the blistering and rash was almost entirely resolved. Four months later, nivolumab was restarted and the patient continued low-dose tapering of prednisone until December. Since completing prednisone, the patient has shown no recurrence of bullous pemphigoid and has not developed any other immune-related adverse events to nivolumab upon rechallenge. Follow-up through October 2021 demonstrates the patient's sites of disease, both in- and out-field, have remained responsive to treatment.

However, the lack of experimental HHV8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma models continues to hinder the pathophysiologic and therapeutic investigations of this disorder. METHODS: The lymphoma cells were obtained from the pleural effusion of a patient with primary HHV8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma and cultured in vitro. RESULTS: We established a novel HHV8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma cell line, designated Pell-1, carrying a c-MYC rearrangement with features distinct from those of HHV8-positive PEL. Moreover, we developed an HHV8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma cell line-derived xenograft model. Pell-1 cells induced profuse lymphomatous ascites and subsequently formed intra-abdominal tumors after intraperitoneal implantation into irradiated nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Thus, this xenograft mouse model mimicked the clinical phenomena observed in patients and recapitulated the sequential stages of aggressive HHV8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma. The bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors JQ1 and birabresib (MK-8628/OTX015) reduced the proliferation of Pell-1 cells in vitro through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The antitumor effect of BET inhibition was also demonstrated in vivo, as birabresib significantly reduced ascites and suppressed tumor progression without apparent adverse effects in the xenografted mice. CONCLUSION: These preclinical findings suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting c-MYC through BET inhibition in HHV8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma.",2021 Dec,20211124.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on a novel cell line-derived xenograft model of primary herpesvirus 8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on a novel cell line-derived xenograft model of primary herpesvirus 8-unrelated effusion large B-cell lymphoma and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccination complications or adverse effects.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a novel model for studying a specific type of lymphoma and the effects of a BET inhibitor, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a novel model for studying a specific type of lymphoma and the effects of a BET inhibitor, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus of the scoring task.",2,95,,
34757513,PMC8578920,A novel definition and treatment of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 based on purinergic signalling.,Hasan D||Shono A||van Kalken CK||van der Spek PJ||Krenning EP||Kotani T,"Hyperinflammation plays an important role in severe and critical COVID-19. Using inconsistent criteria, many researchers define hyperinflammation as a form of very severe inflammation with cytokine storm. Therefore, COVID-19 patients are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs appear to be less efficacious than expected and are sometimes accompanied by serious adverse effects. SARS-CoV-2 promotes cellular ATP release. Increased levels of extracellular ATP activate the purinergic receptors of the immune cells initiating the physiologic pro-inflammatory immune response. Persisting viral infection drives the ATP release even further leading to the activation of the P2X7 purinergic receptors (P2X7Rs) and a severe yet physiologic inflammation. Disease progression promotes prolonged vigorous activation of the P2X7R causing cell death and uncontrolled ATP release leading to cytokine storm and desensitisation of all other purinergic receptors of the immune cells. This results in immune paralysis with co-infections or secondary infections. We refer to this pathologic condition as hyperinflammation. The readily available and affordable P2X7R antagonist lidocaine can abrogate hyperinflammation and restore the normal immune function. The issue is that the half-maximal effective concentration for P2X7R inhibition of lidocaine is much higher than the maximal tolerable plasma concentration where adverse effects start to develop. To overcome this, we selectively inhibit the P2X7Rs of the immune cells of the lymphatic system inducing clonal expansion of Tregs in local lymph nodes. Subsequently, these Tregs migrate throughout the body exerting anti-inflammatory activities suppressing systemic and (distant) local hyperinflammation. We illustrate this with six critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with lidocaine.",2022 Mar,20211110.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses hyperinflammation in COVID-19 and the use of lidocaine as a treatment, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses hyperinflammation in COVID-19 and the use of lidocaine as a treatment, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

There is an urgent need for safe and effective vaccines, and vaccinations, such as mRNA vaccines, have been initiated worldwide. However, the adverse effects of these vaccines remain unclear. We herein present a case of an 80-year-old female on maintenance hemodialysis who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy 4 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. There was no obvious trigger for the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy other than the COVID-19 vaccination, which was the most significant event preceding her presentation. Echocardiograms obtained during her admission allowed us to monitor and show the recovery of left ventricular wall motion. We confirmed the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on the findings, including transient left ventricular dysfunction, electrocardiographic abnormalities, an elevated troponin level, and the absence of occlusive coronary artery disease. In the present case, the vaccination may have triggered emotional or physical stress. Although difficulties are associated with proving the causal relationship in the present case, the temporal relationship between the vaccination and the onset of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is highly suggestive. The adverse effects associated with the vaccine are typical of COVID-19 vaccines administered to date, most of which are acceptable. Therefore, despite our experience of the present case, we still recommend the vaccination for COVID-19 because takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by the COVID-19 vaccine is extremely rare and the prognosis of the patient was good.

As immunotherapy is gradually being applied for the treatment of a large range of solid tumours, the incidence of neurological immune-related adverse events (irAEs) has increased (2). Neurologic toxicities that result in high morbidity rates and even mortality have emerged as serious complications of ICIs (Johnson et al. in J Immuno Cancer 7(1):134, 2019; Wang et al. in JAMA Oncol 4(12):1721, 2018). Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is common cause of neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome (Sebastian et al. in J Thorac Oncol 14(11):1878-1880, 2019). Nevertheless, the distinction between neurologic iRAEs and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNSs) in patients with SCLC treated by ICIs remains challenging (Williams et al.

Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia is often refractory to various treatments, including topical drugs, surgical resection, cryotherapy, and laser therapy. Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy is an innovative and effective treatment for potentially malignant oral disorders and has the potential to control the recurrence of precancerous lesions and cancer. Various pre-treatments or combined therapies have been proposed to increase the efficacy of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy, especially for large, thick, or highly keratinised lesions. We report a case of refractory proliferative verrucous leukoplakia in a 58-year-old female patient who showed rapid recurrence within 1 week of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy despite pre-treatment with microneedle puncture, combined intralesional injection of 5-aminolevulinic acid, and shortened treatment interval. We applied three sessions of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy combined with diode laser drilling pre-treatment at 1-week intervals, which successfully eradicated the lesions without any adverse effects and without any signs of recurrence at the 10-month follow-up.

34582138,,Acute Calcific Band Keratopathy as an Adverse Effect of Recombinant Human Nerve Growth Factor (Cenegermin): A Multicenter Case Series.,Qureshi S||Ferguson TJ||Lim M||You JY||Goshe JM||Hood CT,"PURPOSE: Cenegermin, (OXERVATE) a recently Food and Drug Administration-approved topical formulation of recombinant human nerve growth factor, has been used for the treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy (NK). Corneal deposits have been previously reported as a potential adverse effect; however, the clinical characteristics, visual significance, and treatment options have not been fully described. The purpose of this article is to better characterize corneal deposits occurring during treatment with cenegermin for neurotrophic keratopathy. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter consecutive case series. RESULTS: We identified 5 patients from 3 institutions who developed a white opacity in varying layers of the cornea, consistent with calcium deposition, during treatment with cenegermin. In all cases, the opacity occurred rapidly over the course of a few weeks after initiation of treatment. Histopathologic examination of the cornea from one corneal patient demonstrated extensive calcification of the stroma extending to 90% depth. Before treatment, all patients had stage 2 or 3 NK (Mackie classification). The deposits were visually significant in all patients and did not resolve after cessation of cenegermin. There were no differences in age, sex, etiology of the NK, corneal transplant status, or concurrent medications between the patients who developed a deposit and 15 other patients with stage 2 or 3 NK who did not. One patient was successfully treated with superficial keratectomy with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelation, one patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty, and one patient received a Boston keratoprosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: We report the rapid onset of a corneal opacity after initiation of treatment with cenegermin in patients with stage 2 or 3 NK, consistent with acute calcific band keratopathy. This visually significant adverse finding has not previously been described. We could not identify any risk factors for development. We recommend close monitoring of patients receiving cenegermin therapy because the opacity may be irreversible and may require keratoplasty for visual rehabilitation.",2022 Jan 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on adverse effects of cenegermin, a drug for neurotrophic keratopathy, not on COVID-19 vaccines.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on adverse effects of cenegermin, a drug for neurotrophic keratopathy, not on COVID-19 vaccines.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses adverse effects related to a treatment for neurotrophic keratopathy, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses adverse effects related to a treatment for neurotrophic keratopathy, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,95,,

An adverse effect of its use is reactivation of latent infections, such as tuberculosis (TB). TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and continues to be an important public health problem in some developing countries, such as Brazil. The present report describes the case of a patient with CD who developed pulmonary TB while receiving adalimumab therapy. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old penitentiary worker presented with colonic CD that was intolerant to azathioprine and was started on adalimumab. After 3 months, he experienced coughing, fever, and weight loss, and was diagnosed with pulmonary TB. A chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test performed before he started taking adalimumab were negative for latent TB. The patient was treated for 9 months to cure his infection. The use of adalimumab was suspended while the TB was investigated and he took mesalazine to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission of CD. CONCLUSIONS Adequate screening and chemoprophylaxis for latent TB are indicated in patients at high risk of infection.

Reduction of ptosis has been achieved with oral and topical ocular medications. However, these medications can result in systemic and ocular adverse effects. A novel eye drop seems to be effective in reducing ptosis while minimizing adverse effects. PURPOSE: This case report aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of topical oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.1%, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, in temporary elimination of ptosis associated with myasthenia gravis. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis and long-standing ptosis in the right eye presented to improve the asymmetrical appearance of her eyelids. One drop of oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.1% was instilled in the right eye of the patient. Within 2 hours, the ptosis was eliminated, the margin-reflex distance 1 increased by 2.0 mm, and the superior visual field measured by a superior 36-point screening test increased by 15 points. The effect lasted for at least 7 hours. Of note, there was a decrease in elevation of the contralateral nonptotic eyelid that did not receive a drop of oxymetazoline, which might occur only in myasthenia gravis.

On March 18, 2021 the European Medicines Agency reported a serious and rare adverse effect of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine; most of these cases were associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). To date, there are no cases of TTS-related CVST reported after receipt of either of the 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States. We report a case of CVST with the Moderna mRNA vaccine. CASE REPORT A healthy 45-year-old male patient without any risk factors presented with new-onset seizures 8 days after the receipt of the 2nd dose of Moderna (mRNA-1273), with concomitant SAH as a complication. One day prior to admission, he noted headaches and neck pain unrelieved by over-the-counter analgesics. Computed tomography (CT) scan brain without contrast revealed a left frontal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) along with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain confirmed the CT findings as well as anterior superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. He had normal platelet count with a negative thrombophilia work-up and cancer screening. He was successfully anticoagulated with heparin and discharged on warfarin without neurological sequelae or further seizures. The case was reported to the US Vaccine Surveillance System.

The novelty of this case is the suspected pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the occurrence of a brief manic episode concerning a 50-year-old man with no psychiatric history, first started on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy and then switched to clarithromycin for left basal pneumonia. Shortly after the antibiotic prescription, he presented psychiatric symptomatology (logorrhea, elevated mood, irritability, increase in physical activity and delusions). The antibiotic was stopped and the patient received lorazepam (2.5 mg p.o.) to treat psychomotor agitation. Approximately 12 h after clarithromycin cessation, amelioration was already observed, supporting the diagnosis of a clarithromycin-induced manic episode. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was then reintroduced because of the pneumonia and psychiatric symptoms reemerged. This second antibiotic was also stopped, and 1 week later, the patient was symptom-free. CONCLUSION: The emergence of psychiatric side effects related to antibiotherapy, which is a common treatment, can greatly impact a patient's quality of life. Early recognition and intervention could substantially influence the administered medical care and recovery. Moreover, given the widespread use of antibiotics including in combination, we thought our case report might be clinically useful as a clinical reminder relevant to the use of antibiotic combinations.",2021 Aug 11,20210811.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of antibiotics, specifically clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of antibiotics, specifically clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, which does not meet the specified criteria.",2,90,,

Al-though more than 170 species have been identified, the majority of human NTM diseases are caused by fewer than 20 species. Reported mycobacteria osteomyelitis cases are fewer than 200 worldwide, with patient age ranging from 6 - 88 years. Many underlying conditions, including immunocompromised patients, wounds, and physical exercise, are associated with the disease. When treating this infection, the first step to consider is an early diagnosis in the course of illness to prevent significant bone destruction and loss of function. To treat mycobacteria osteomyelitis, prolonged antibiotic administration, often in conjunction with surgical intervention, is typically required. METHODS AND RESULTS: A case of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection leading to calcaneal osteomyelitis after ankle local injection therapy is diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bacteria culture, and is further confirmed by the Next Generation Sequencing of the nucleotides. The patient recovered gradually after more than 8 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection could be challenging especially with osteomyelitis.

Complications produced by the indwelling catheters, like patulous urethra and bladder neck destruction, usually lead to severe incontinence and significant nursing difficulties. Here, we describe a rare case, a urinary bladder opening representing massive and extensive destruction of the urethra and bladder sphincter due to an indwelling catheter. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 46-year-old paraplegic woman complaining of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and severe urinary incontinence. She suffered from persistent malodorous urine and skin breakdowns from constant urine leakage. The vaginal examination revealed extensive destruction of the urethra and a 10 cm opening permitting the urinary bladder wall to prolapse into the vagina.

34147315,,Hydroxyurea-induced genital ulcers and erosions: Two case reports.,Blum AE||Tsiaras WG||Kemp JM,"Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent used for myeloproliferative disorders and sickle cell anemia that is well known to cause painful mucocutaneous ulcers, typically involving the legs or mouth. However, genital ulcerations due to hydroxyurea therapy are a rare, and likely underrecognized, adverse effect with only a few cases reported in the literature to date. Ulcers of the lower legs caused by hydroxyurea are associated with a diagnostic delay, and this is likely exacerbated in cases of genital ulceration due to a lack of awareness. Herein we present two cases of painful genital ulceration in patients on hydroxyurea therapy.

We report a rare case of solitary pharyngeal metastasis as first presentation of RCC. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74 years-old man was referred to our hospital due to rapidly progressive dyspnoea and dysphagia. Physical examination showed a large right para-pharyngeal mass. Imaging findings showed a 5.5 cm mass, suspicious for malignancy, which extended to right para and retro-pharyngeal spaces with compression of the major right cervical vessels, C2-C3 vertebral bodies osteolysis, dural sac compression and dislocation. Futhermore, a small (2.6 x 2 cm) mass located at the upper pole of the right kidney was shown. Patient underwent partial trans-oral removal of the mass. Pathological examination and immunochemistry resulting strongly suggestive for metastatic RCC. Considering the metastatic stage of the tumour and the rapidly progressive clinical worsening with poor performance status, we offered the patient a palliative treatment with tyrosine kinase and cytoreductive radiotherapy on vertebral bodies. The patient developed a rapidly progressive multifocal metastatic disease and died 4 months after the presentation. CONCLUSION: We think that our case is noteworthy for some aspects. Firstly, pharyngeal localizations of RCC are very rare and this is the first case of solitary pharyngeal metastasis. Secondly, this metastatic lesion was really particular because it was synchronous and twice as big than the primary tumour. Thirdly, this case is consistent with previous evidence that synchronous compared with metachronous metastasis RCC is associated with adverse effect on outcome and response to targeted treatment.",2023 Aug,20210609.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on a rare case of renal cell carcinoma metastasis.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on a rare case of renal cell carcinoma metastasis.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a rare case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses a rare case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
34100221,PMC8494873,Switching from lipoprotein apheresis to evolocumab in FH siblings on hemodialysis: case reports and discussion.,Ishii T||Ogura M||Nakamori H||Hori M||Harada-Shiba M||Tamura K||Oyama K,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic kidney disease, especially end-stage renal disease (ESRD), are common and put patients at a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). ESRD concomitant with FH may further increase the risk of ASCVD. Achieving target levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is difficult owing to the limitations of statin administration due to its side effects in ESRD. Therefore, some FH patients with ESRD require lipoprotein apheresis for the prevention of secondary ASCVD events. Although proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors may offer a safe and effective option for lowering lipid levels in such patients, no guidelines are available for their use. Here, we report the case of two male siblings with FH in secondary prevention undergoing hemodialysis combined with PCSK9 inhibitor treatment. The siblings, who showed a heterozygous c.1846-1G>A mutation in the LDLR gene, underwent hemodialysis. In combination with the lipoprotein apheresis, siblings were administered evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor. Both the siblings had coronary artery disease, diabetes, and ESRD, and received hemodialysis.

34099425,,The rationality involved in the popular use of coffee (Coffea sp) and sunflower seed (Helianthus annuus) for the treatment of vitiligo: a case report.,Leite PM||Alves SDO||Castilho RO,"INTRODUCTION: Vitiligo is a dermatological disease that affects about 0.38% to 2.9% of the world population. Currently, the main treatments used for vitiligo involve the use of topical drugs such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, systemic treatment with steroids and even surgical grafts and, in acute cases, depigmenting treatments. Natural products are an alternative for the treatment of vitiligo: mamacadela (Brosimum gaudichaudii), a plant rich in furanocoumarins, and sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus), rich in phenolic substances, are already used to treat vitiligo. There are also popular reports of the use of a preparation containing coffee (Coffea sp) and sunflower seed (Helianthus annuus) to treat vitiligo. CASE REPORT: A female patient, 28 years old, diagnosed with vitiligo, reported having obtained a positive result in the repigmentation of the pale white patches after the daily use of a preparation containing coffee and sunflower seed for about one year. DISCUSSION: Data from the scientific literature demonstrated that chemical constituents of these plants, such as chlorogenic acid and its isomers, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action, and substances such as linoleic acid and vitamins E and B, which help in the process of melanin formation on the skin, may be responsible for the observed repigmentation of the patches.

Although most of their adverse effects are mild to moderate, they occasionally can cause life-threatening interstitial lung disease. We aimed to present a case of lung adenocarcinoma successfully re-treated with erlotinib after recovery with effective treatment of erlotinib-induced interstitial lung disease. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old nonsmoking woman was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. After progression with first-line chemotherapy, erlotinib 150 mg daily was initiated. On the 45th day of erlotinib treatment, interstitial lung disease occurred and erlotinib was discontinued. Clinical improvement was achieved with dexamethasone treatment and erlotinib was re-initiated. Ten weeks after re-initiation of erlotinib, 100 mg daily partial response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of interstitial lung disease is higher in men, smokers, and patients with pulmonary fibrosis.

The duration of morbidity is increased in refractory cases; and therefore, the preservation of hearing and the prevention of adverse effects with steroid therapy are serious long term issues to consider. Long-term follow up of patients treated for ASHL was performed retrospectively in order to elucidate the pathogenesis of ASHL, evaluate the consequences of steroid therapy, and determine a promising treatment course. The cohort in this study consists of four female patients with refractory ASHL that were followed for 16-26 years. Three patients already had profound deafness on one side, probably due to ASHL, before the initiation of steroid treatment. ASHL was managed with steroid administration and the hearing was evaluated through regular audiometric tests (173-212 times). The relationship between pure tone threshold average and steroid dose was reviewed over a long-term follow-up period for each patient. During follow-up, hearing deficit progressed rapidly several times in all patients, as did responsiveness to steroid therapy. Long-term high-dose steroid therapy was not required for hearing maintenance. Hearing thresholds were nearly maintained in three patients during the 16- to 21- year follow-up, and gradually declined over a 26-year follow-up period in one patient. Considering the progress due to presbycusis, the maintenance of hearing was considered sufficient in all patients. No serious adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. Management of patients affected by ASHL with regular audiometry allowed for hearing maintenance without the morbidity of prolonged steroid therapy.

Anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders occur in about 15% of pregnant and lactating women; however, no studies have examined brotizolam transfer across the placenta or its excretion into breast milk. In this case report, we assessed brotizolam concentrations in maternal and neonatal blood, cord blood, and breast milk. Materials and Methods: Brotizolam concentrations in maternal serum, breast milk, cord blood, and neonatal serum were measured while the mother was taking oral brotizolam 0.25 mg once daily. Case Report: A 28-year-old woman diagnosed with bipolar II disorder received brotizolam during pregnancy (28-40 weeks' gestational age) and lactation, along with sertraline, alprazolam, and trazodone. A male infant weighing 3,412 g was born at 40 weeks of gestation. Neonatal abstinence syndrome manifested as fever, limb tremor, and central cyanosis, requiring oxygenation and intravenous phenobarbital administration for 4 days.

With little evidence, much of the guidance and recommendations available for management are based on clinical judgement. Although percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty can effectively relieve the severe pain associated with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that do not respond to conventional treatments, the effect of balloon kyphoplasty on SIADH associated with vertebral compression fracture remains unknown. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to severe pain associated with lumbar compression fracture and pain-related SIADH. Since her pain could not be relieved by analgesics, she underwent percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty, a minimally invasive procedure intended to relieve pain. After the surgery, the patient's pain almost completely disappeared and her sodium level was gradually corrected within 3 days without any adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is a novel treatment option for SIADH associated with vertebral compression fracture. In the case presented here, it rapidly reduced pain and disability and also improved severe pain-associated SIADH without adverse effects. It may offer an alternative to pain regimens consisting of drugs, such as duloxetine, pregabalin, and opioids, that may exacerbate SIADH and hyponatremia.

Ribavirin was discontinued after the sixth dose, and a single dose of intravenous rasburicase (7.5 mg) was administered. On day 3, the patient's serum uric and creatinine concentrations had decreased to 4.7 mg/dL and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. He continued to recover on antibiotics and was discharged with normal uric acid and serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSION: We report a case of severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury that developed early after initiation of ribavirin for RSV infection and suspected bacterial pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient without hepatitis C, requiring ribavirin discontinuation and rasburicase administration. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe hyperuricemia in a patient treated with ribavirin for RSV infection rather than chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute and severe hyperuricemia following ribavirin administration.",2021 Apr 22,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to ribavirin treatment, specifically severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to ribavirin treatment, specifically severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,90,,

However, it is underutilized in the United States because of several life-threatening adverse effects, including clozapine-associated myocarditis (CAM), and a limited understanding of how to manage these complications. To date, recommendations for rechallenging patients with CAM that incorporate the cardiac literature or cardioprotective medications have not been developed. FINDINGS: In this article, we outline a protocol developed with cardiologists and guided by the cardiac literature that provides direction on how to monitor for the initial development of CAM and how to rechallenge patients with CAM. Furthermore, we present 2 successful cases of clozapine rechallenge that were managed using this protocol.

This case report describes a non-diabetic patient without any other chronic diseases, who experienced mild hypoglycemia related to HCQ used for COVID-19 treatment.Methods: All etiologies causing hypoglycemia were investigated and a 72-hour fast test was performed.Results: A 34-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a high fever, cough, and chest pain. The result of his COVID-19 PCR test was positive. He received HCQ for 10 days for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. He experienced fatigue, dizziness, severe headache, weakness and feeling of hunger after discontinuation of HCQ during his isolation at home. Before COVID-19 infection, he never experienced hypoglycemia symptoms. He did not have a history of chronic diseases, drug use, alcohol consumption, or smoking. A 72-hour fasting test was performed. He complained about headache and weakness during the 72-hour test period. The PG level was determined as 49 mg/dl during these symptoms. Concurrent insulin and C-peptide levels were <2 mU/mL and 0.553 ng/mL, respectively. ACTH, cortisol, growth hormones, liver and kidney function tests were normal. HbA1c level was 4.7% (28 mmol/mol) (Normal Range %4,5-5,7).Conclusion: Hypoglycemia may be observed as an adverse effect of HCQ used for COVID-19 infection even in patients without chronic diseases and comorbidities.

However, they are not without associated risks. In rare cases, new-onset and exacerbations of heart failure have been associated with their use. The purpose of this report is to raise awareness of the need for further study of adalimumab for this adverse effect, as well as to recognize the need for research to find new HS treatment modalities for better care of the broad patient population. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 67-year-old man with a history of severe HS and major depressive disorder who came to our hospital complaining of dyspnea, fatigue upon exertion, and lower-extremity edema of 2 weeks' evolution. Symptoms began after the re-initiation of adalimumab for his severe HS. During hospitalization, he was diagnosed with decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). Extensive studies, looking for ischemic or infectious etiology, yielded negative results. Being aware of adalimumab's potential adverse effects, the team discontinued the medication as a probable cause of his condition. Unfortunately, the patient died secondary to heart failure and septicemia. CONCLUSIONS The unusual but potentially life-threatening appearance of heart failure secondary to adalimumab use merits thorough attention by primary care doctors and specialists.

The MET exon 14 skipping mutation (METex14del) is found in 2%-3% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies reported that NSCLC patients harboring a METex14del responded well to MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including tepotinib. Tepotinib is a highly selective, once-daily oral MET inhibitor that has shown promising clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with METex14del. The Food and Drug Administration accepted a new drug application for tepotinib as a treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring METex14del in February 2021 [Correction added on 5 March 2021, after first online publication: the FDA approval date for tepotinib has been corrected from 'September 2019' to 'February 2021'.]. However, in the previous clinical trials involving MET-TKIs, only patients with stable central nervous system metastases were eligible, and those with untreated symptomatic brain metastases (BMs) were excluded. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of MET-TKIs in that population remains unknown. We herein report a case of dramatic intracranial response to tepotinib in a patient with symptomatic BMs from lung adenocarcinoma harboring METex14del. In the current report, the symptoms derived from multiple BMs (headache and loss of appetite) rapidly disappeared, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination showed that all the lesions were too small to measure only 23 days after the commencement of tepotinib. For NSCLC patients with multiple BMs, whole-brain irradiation is a standard-of-care therapy, but its adverse effects on neurocognition are concerning. Tepotinib might therefore be a therapeutic option for NSCLC patients with symptomatic multiple BMs harboring METex14del.",2021 Mar,20210203.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the efficacy of tepotinib in treating lung adenocarcinoma with a specific mutation, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the efficacy of tepotinib in treating lung adenocarcinoma with a specific mutation, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Hemocoagulase was administered to manage bleeding; however, bleeding signs, such as hemoptysis, massive epistaxis, and ecchymosis, recurred. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with acquired hypofibrinogenemia on the basis of the reduced plasma fibrinogen level after hemocoagulase administration and lack of other causes of bleeding. INTERVENTION: Hemocoagulase administration was discontinued, and fibrinogen-containing plasma products were administered.

33430802,PMC7802127,A case of recurrent sterile abscesses following tetanus-diphtheria vaccination treated with corticosteroids.,Kaya A||Kaya SY,"BACKGROUND: Vaccinations have been widely used worldwide since their invention to prevent various diseases, but they can also have some adverse effects ranging from mild local reactions to serious side effects. These adverse effects are generally self-limited and resolve within a short time without any treatment. While a sterile abscess following vaccination is a rare condition in adults, many cases have been reported regarding children in the literature. Here, we report a case of recurrent sterile abscesses, which occurred after a Td vaccination, treated with corticosteroids. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year old woman was admitted to our department with a complaint of swelling at the site of the vaccination. On physical examination, this mass was about 6 x 6 cm in size and fluctuating, but there were no pain complaints and no redness present. She had received her Td vaccination 3 weeks ago and the swelling had started at the site of the injection 4 days following this immunization. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and local antibiotic cream were administered for 10 days. The laboratory values were unremarkable. Despite the administration of antibiotics, the swelling did not regress, and on the contrary, continued to increase in size. On ultrasound, two interconnected abscesses were observed in the subcutaneous area, and did not involve the muscle tissue. Later, the abscesses were completely drained, and the samples were cultured. The current antibiotics were continued. The gram staining of the samples revealed abundant leukocytes but no microorganisms. The solid and liquid cultures of the materials remained negative. Despite the administration of multiple drainages and antibiotics, the mass recurred. Finally, the patient was considered to have a sterile abscess due to Td immunization. The antimicrobials were stopped. Local and oral corticosteroids were initiated. The swelling regressed significantly, and the treatments continued for 7 days. The patient has been doing well and has had no recurrence for over a year.

33395116,,Corneal Crosslinking to Regress Pathologic Corneal Neovascularization Before High-Risk Keratoplasty.,Schaub F||Hou Y||Zhang W||Bock F||Hos D||Cursiefen C,"PURPOSE: Corneal neovascularization is the main risk factor for graft rejection after high-risk penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Corneal crosslinking (CXL) has been shown to regress pathological corneal blood and lymphatic vessels and to reduce the risk of graft rejection after high-risk PK experimentally in mice. The aim of this work was to analyze whether CXL is also able to regress corneal neovascularization in patients and is a safe procedure in the context of high-risk PK. METHODS: This retrospective case series included 5 patients with progressive corneal neovascularization and the need for high-risk PK because of graft rejection and/or keratitis that received CXL and PK between April 2019 and January 2020. CXL was performed before or in combination with PK and the effect of CXL on corneal neovascularization was assessed morphometrically on slit-lamp images. Patients were followed up to determine the incidence of adverse effects and graft rejection. RESULTS: In 1 case, peripheral corneal CXL was performed first as a single procedure, followed by an additional peripheral CXL procedure combined with PK. In all other cases, peripheral CXL was directly combined with PK. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. Peripheral CXL resulted in a reduction of corneal neovascularization (mean reduction of 70.5% +/- 22.7%). Revascularization was not observed. All transplants remained clear and without immune reactions (mean follow-up 16.4 +/- 14.9 weeks, range 4-42 weeks).

Angioedema is a well-known adverse effect, which involves the viscera rarely. This is a case of a 44-year-old African-American man with newly diagnosed hypertension, who presented with lower abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Based on the clinical picture and radiographic findings, lisinopril-induced intestinal angioedema was diagnosed. He recovered with supportive treatment, and the lisinopril was permanently discontinued. The mechanism of angioedema is thought to be the inhibition of ACE-mediated degradation of bradykinin, which is a peptide responsible for vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. While the external angioedema is unmistakable, intestinal angioedema has a relatively non-specific presentation and chronology, often leading to missed diagnosis and unnecessary interventions. Most common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Characteristic radiographic findings include 'doughnut sign' and 'stacked coin' appearance. Treatment is supportive.

At the first visit to our institution, a 20x20 mm black and flat lesion on the lower third of the posterior vaginal wall and a polypoid mass near the vaginal fornix were detected by gynecologic examination. Study of the tumor on the posterior vaginal wall suggested that it did not extend to the uterine cervix. The preoperative diagnosis was vaginal malignant melanoma FIGO stage I (cT1, cN0, cM0). The patient underwent a total vaginectomy, pelvic and inguinal lymphadenectomy, modified radical hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The tumor cells were arranged in sheets and nests and exhibited nuclear pleomorphism, eosinophilic cytoplasm, brisk mitotic activity, and melanin production. The overlying mucosa was ulcerated. The tumor thickness was 2.5 mm and no residual lesion was found at the surgical margin. No adjuvant therapies were performed.

We started an intravenous drip supplemented with branched chain amino acids for liver protection. Approximately 6 hours later, blood ammonia level improved to 88 microg/dL, which approached the reference value. Consciousness level improved over time, reaching a level of alertness on day 5 after starting chemotherapy. 5-FU was suspected to be the cause of impaired consciousness due to hyperammonemia, but the exact cause could not be identified because most of the previously reported cases were given L-OHP, bolus 5-FU, and other concomitant medications. In this case, since there were no other concomitant medications, it is highly probable that continuous infusion of 5-FU alone caused impaired consciousness due to hyperammonemia. This is an important case that indicates the need to monitor carefully for the occurrence of hyperammonemia when 5-FU is administered continuously; it also proposes future issues for investigation.",2020 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a case of hyperammonemia caused by a chemotherapy drug (5-fluorouracil) and does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The input item discusses a case of hyperammonemia caused by a chemotherapy drug (5-fluorouracil) and does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

Most patients tolerate immunotherapy without any significant adverse events. Nevertheless, a significant number of patients still experience adverse effects. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been described as mostly related to warm autoantibodies. The following case report describes cold agglutinin disease with hemolysis secondary to Pembrolizumab therapy for the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old woman noted a left neck mass 4 months prior to her presentation. A biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with primary lung cancer. Further evaluation revealed the tumor to be PDL-1-positive. She was started on Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and carboplatin chemotherapy regimen. Her CBC was within normal limits when she started therapy, but within 4 weeks hemoglobin dropped to 4.3 g/dL. Further evaluation showed high cryoglobulin levels and a high cold agglutinin titer. Complement C3 DAT was positive. A peripheral smear showed clumps of red cells and the serum IgM was elevated. The diagnosis of CAD was made. She was then started on Rituximab. Imaging showed a significant response, with decreased disease burden. CONCLUSIONS Our case shows a unique presentation of CAD, initially presumed to be myelosuppression secondary to chemotherapy. Instead, a peripheral smear revealed Pembrolizumab to be the cause of cold agglutinin disease. Due to the relatively unknown association between these 2 entities, patient care was delayed. Finally, after initiation of Rituximab therapy, the patient's CBC began to recover.",2020 Sep 5,20200905.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on pembrolizumab-induced cold agglutinin disease.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on pembrolizumab-induced cold agglutinin disease.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of cold agglutinin disease induced by Pembrolizumab, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of cold agglutinin disease induced by Pembrolizumab, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,
32826413,,Hyperammonemic encephalopathy during XELOX regimen. Is it capecitabine or oxaliplatin responsible?,Di Federico A||Nuvola G||Sisi M||Lenzi B||Nobili E||Campana D,"Hyperammonemic encephalopathy represents a rare adverse effect of several chemotherapeutic agents, occurring in about 0.7% of patients treated with fluoropyrimidines, and it is independent from dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. Instead, its physiopathology is linked to the inhibition of Krebs cycle by fluoroacetate, leading to decreased ATP production, and to the inhibition of the urea cycle. Oxaliplatin seems to induce hyperammonemic encephalopathy in a similar way, acting on mitochondria. Here, we report the intriguing case of acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy in a 65-year-old patient with preserved liver function, who was treated with oxaliplatin and capecitabine for a metastatic, G1, atypical lung carcinoid. We reviewed the literature and found very few reports of oxaliplatin or capecitabine-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Out of five cases of capecitabine-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy analyzed (four plus our case), median time to hyperammonemic encephalopathy onset was 6 days, with median serum ammonia levels of 213 mumol/L. Oxaliplatin-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy analyzed cases were three (two plus ours), with a median time to hyperammonemic encephalopathy of 11 days and median serum ammonia levels of 167 mumol/L. Identified predisposing factors for chemotherapy-induced hyperammonemia, such as dehydration, liver and renal impairment, infections, and sarcopenia were absent in our case. We hypothesize that the combination of a platinum-derivative and a fluoropyrimidine multiplies the risk of hyperammonemic encephalopathy, even in the absence of predisposing factors nor impaired liver function. We therefore suggest to always consider the risk of hyperammonemia when starting fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy, especially combined with platinum-derivatives, and to timely investigate neurologic symptoms monitoring ammonia serum levels.",2020 Nov,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by chemotherapy drugs, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by chemotherapy drugs, not complications of COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to chemotherapy agents, specifically oxaliplatin and capecitabine, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to chemotherapy agents, specifically oxaliplatin and capecitabine, and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Due to mechanism of action; most common side effect may be seen with hemorrhage. Here in we reported that a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation presented with thrombocytopenia while taking rivaroxaban. CASE REPORT: A 76-year-old female patient with atrial fibrillation was given rivaroxaban, after lack of dose administration of warfarin and gastrointestinal bleeding. In 12th dayweek of treatment, the patient was admitted to emergency department (ED) with oral mucosal bleeding and petechial spots.The patient diagnosed as Drug-induced Thrombocytopenia (DITP)due to rivaroxaban use, after ruled out most possibilities ofITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura).

32792294,,Clozapine-induced pulmonary embolism in a patient with minimal pre-existing risk factors.,Waters K||Goodwin H||Morrow G,"OBJECTIVES: Although the risk of antipsychotic-induced venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been definitively established, guidelines recommending prophylactic anticoagulation do not yet exist. Several algorithms have been proposed that suggest possible prophylaxis with an anticoagulant medication on the basis of pre-existing VTE risk factors. We present a case of antipsychotic-induced VTE despite the patient's low-risk status so that practitioners may better understand which factors may or may not constitute a major risk in this population when making a determination about prophylactic anticoagulation. CASE SUMMARY: We present a patient case of a 56-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder who was treated with clozapine at an inpatient psychiatric unit. Although he would be classified as low risk for VTE on the basis of the proposed algorithms, he experienced a pulmonary embolism by day 17 of treatment and required transfer to a medical unit. This patient displayed sensitivity to other adverse effects associated with clozapine during his treatment course, including tachycardia, sialorrhea, enuresis, and bowel obstruction. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Many of the known risk factors for antipsychotic-induced VTE were not present in this patient, including immobility, hyperprolactinemia, and coagulation abnormalities. The recent initiation of clozapine and obesity seem to be the only identified risk factors, although malignancy and abnormal antiphospholipid antibody levels were not able to be ruled out. It is difficult to determine if this patient experienced a VTE owing to a relatively high degree of sensitivity to clozapine, as evidenced by the myriad of other adverse effects that he experienced. This case highlights the need to determine true antipsychotic-induced VTE risk factors, including evaluation of comorbid adverse effects that occur in addition to the VTE. This information will help to guide future decision-making regarding the risk versus benefit of providing prophylactic anticoagulation for patients during initiation of antipsychotic treatment.",2021 Jan-Feb,20200810.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to clozapine treatment, specifically pulmonary embolism, rather than complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to clozapine treatment, specifically pulmonary embolism, rather than complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

32761113,,Crushing deutetrabenazine for treatment of tardive dyskinesia in a patient with severe orofacial symptoms: A case report.,Wietholter JP||Sizemore J||Piechowski K,"PURPOSE: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that results from exposure to dopamine receptor antagonists and/or first- and second-generation antipsychotics. While cessation of the offending agent(s) through early detection is recommended, TD symptoms may be irreversible and require further treatment. Deutetrabenazine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of persistent TD. Irreversible orofacial dyskinesia, a common affliction in TD, can progress to severe oropharyngeal dysphagia requiring alternate means of nutrition and medication delivery. Enteral administration of crushed deutetrabenazine has not been studied, and its use to treat TD in patients who cannot take medications by mouth has not been reported previously. SUMMARY: A 38-year-old female patient with a history of bipolar I disorder and TD secondary to atypical antipsychotic exposure developed worsening athetosis, hyperkinesia, and severe orofacial dyskinesia after initiation of ziprasidone. The patient had no improvement after discontinuation of atypical antipsychotics and required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for nutrition due to persistent aspiration and inability to tolerate oral nutrition. Despite a lack of information regarding administration of crushed deutetrabenazine tablets via PEG, that form of therapy was initiated and resulted in improvement of TD symptoms without noticeable adverse effects. CONCLUSION: TD can result in significant orofacial dyskinesia with impaired delivery of needed medications and nutrition.

Phage therapy is a promising strategy to manage such infections including those involving antibiotic-resistant microbes, and to target microbial biofilms. Experience with phage therapy for infections associated with retained hardware is limited. A 62-year-old diabetic man with a history of right total knee arthroplasty 11 years prior who had suffered multiple episodes of prosthetic knee infection despite numerous surgeries and prolonged courses of antibiotics, with progressive clinical worsening and development of severe allergies to antibiotics, had been offered limb amputation for persistent right prosthetic knee infection due to Klebsiella pneumoniae complex. Intravenous phage therapy was initiated as a limb-salvaging intervention. METHODS: The patient received 40 intravenous doses of a single phage (KpJH46Phi2) targeting his bacterial isolate, alongside continued minocycline (which he had been receiving when he developed increasing pain, swelling, and erythema prior to initiation of phage therapy). Serial cytokine and biomarker measurements were performed before, during, and after treatment. The in vitro anti-biofilm activity of KpJH46Phi2, minocycline and the combination thereof was evaluated against a preformed biofilm of the patient's isolate and determined by safranin staining. RESULTS: Phage therapy resulted in resolution of local symptoms and signs of infection and recovery of function. The patient did not experience treatment-related adverse effects and remained asymptomatic 34 weeks after completing treatment while still receiving minocycline. A trend in biofilm biomass reduction was noted 22 hours after exposure to KpJH46Phi2 (P = .063). The addition of phage was associated with a satisfactory outcome in this case of intractable biofilm-associated prosthetic knee infection.

32683394,PMC7386550,Myocardial Bridging: A Case Presentation of Atypical Chest Pain Syndrome in a Young Woman.,Duymun S||Misodi E,"BACKGROUND Myocardial bridging, although frequent, is often a forgotten cause of angina. It is a congenital anomaly in which the coronary artery tunnels through the myocardium with the overlying muscle, termed a myocardial bridge. The tunneled artery is prone to increased myocardial compression, mechanical load, endothelial damage, and vascular remodeling. During myocardial systole, the tunneled artery undergoes narrowing caused by myocardial compression, which leads to disruption of blood flow, thereby precipitating angina, arrhythmias, infarction, and sudden cardiac death. CASE REPORT Here, we present a case of a 29-year-old white woman who presented with atypical left-sided achy chest pain, occurring primarily at rest. Further evaluation showed mildly elevated troponins, with normal electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and CTA chest. She subsequently underwent coronary angiography and was found to have myocardial bridging of her left anterior descending artery, with compression of up to 40% during systole. She was initially treated with diltiazem, but due to adverse effects was transitioned to metoprolol succinate, which she has tolerated well. CONCLUSIONS Myocardial bridging, although benign in nature, carries a vast array of complications requiring these patients to undergo prompt diagnosis and treatment. Vascular spasm, wall stress of the tunneled artery, and intensity of systolic constriction coupled with any delay in management can lead to ischemia, infarction, dysrhythmias, and death. Therefore, it is imperative that patients who have low clinical suspicion for atherosclerosis but who are presenting with anginal equivalents undergo coronary angiography to assess for myocardial bridging and receive immediate treatment.",2020 Jul 19,20200719.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses myocardial bridging and its complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses myocardial bridging and its complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

In this case series, co-consumption with other drugs occurred in 9 of 12 cases, most commonly alcohol, cannabis and other contemporary SCs. In five cases, 4F-MDMB-BINACA was also detected. The described cases demonstrate various adverse effects that might be associated with 5F-MDMB-PICA. Observed physical adverse effects were mainly balance deficiencies and ocular effects such as reddened conjunctivae, glassy eyes and delayed or unresponsive pupil light reactions. Observed mental and behavioral effects were mainly changing moods, aggression, confusion, erratic behavior, mental leaps, disorientation, slowed reaction, logorrhea and slurred speech. Due to the fast changing market of synthetic cannabinoids, data on such new appearing substances are basically scarce.

Hypoglycemia is a rare adverse effect associated with its use. We report a case of multiple episodes of severe hypoglycemia in a non-diabetic patient on treatment with tigecycline for cellulitis following snake bite. CASE REPORT A 45-years-old male was admitted with cellulitis of left leg due to snake bite with sepsis, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. A transtracheal aspirate culture showed infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and parenteral tigecycline was started based on the drug-sensitivity testing results. Multiple severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred, with persistently low blood glucose levels in the subsequent days. Tigecycline was stopped at the physician's discretion due to completion of the recommended course of treatment. The blood glucose levels continued to remain either below or on the lower end of the normal range before it started rising gradually. Tigecycline was again started based on another drug-sensitivity testing. A total of 4 episodes of hypoglycemia occurred over the next 2 days, and tigecycline was stopped prematurely. The patient's condition gradually improved with no more hypoglycemic episodes, and he was finally discharged. CONCLUSIONS We report a non-diabetic patient of cellulitis following snake bite who suffered from tigecycline-induced severe hypoglycemic episodes that persisted for a prolonged period of time. After a thorough search of the published literature, we could not find such a case of severe and sustained hypoglycemia due to tigecycline in an individual without diabetes and not on any hypoglycemic agent.",2020 Jul 15,20200715.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on the adverse effects of the antibiotic tigecycline.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on the adverse effects of the antibiotic tigecycline.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses severe hypoglycemia induced by tigecycline in a non-diabetic patient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses severe hypoglycemia induced by tigecycline in a non-diabetic patient, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Most data regarding the safety of esomeprazole during pregnancy are derived from studies on omeprazole, and the data characterizing esomeprazole transfer across the placenta and excretion into breast milk are limited. In this report, we discuss the safety of esomeprazole with reference to drug concentrations in maternal and neonatal blood and breast milk. Materials and Methods: After the patient provided informed consent, esomeprazole concentrations in maternal serum, breast milk, cord blood, and infant's serum were measured after 10 mg of maternal oral esomeprazole administration. Case Report: A 34-year-old female diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis received esomeprazole before and during pregnancy and lactation. The esomeprazole concentration in cord blood was 40% of the level in maternal serum. At 12 hours after delivery (23.2 hours after dose), omeprazole was not detected in the infant's serum. In breast milk, esomeprazole concentrations at 0.7, 4.0, and 8.2 hours after the last dose were 10.5, 19.6, and 3.0 ng/mL, respectively, and esomeprazole was not detected at 10 hours after maternal administration. The calculated daily infant dose of esomeprazole through breast milk was 0.003 mg/[kg.day]. The infant demonstrated normal developmental progress and no detectable drug-related adverse effects. Discussion and Conclusions: Exposure to esomeprazole through placenta and breast milk was not clinically relevant in the infant.

Patients on ICI may also develop upper gastrointestinal symptoms and undergo measurement of gastric emptying. AIMS: Our aim was to review records of patients with gastroparesis following ICI therapy at two medical centers. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients at Mayo Clinic and Brigham and Women's/Dana-Farber Cancer Center (BWH/DFCC) who underwent gastric scintigraphy for the assessment of symptoms of gastroparesis following ICI treatment up to January 2020. Clinical presentation, medical history, laboratory evaluation, imaging, treatment, and outcomes were retrieved from the records. Gastroparesis was diagnosed as delayed gastric emptying (GE) measured by gastric scintigraphy. RESULTS: At Mayo Clinic, 2 patients (median age 59 years, 1 male [M], 1 female [F]) had delayed GE, while 4 patients (median age 53 years, 3M, 1F) had normal GE following ICI use. Of those with delayed GE (diagnosed after 38 and 2 months of ICI initiation), 1 patient was treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma with ipilimumab; a second patient with breast cancer was treated with pembrolizumab. At BWH/DFCC, 2 patients (median age 56 years, 1M, 1F) had normal GE after ICI treatment, while a 62-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer developed gastroparesis 3 months following initiation of nivolumab.

32511159,,Case Report: Posterior Uveitis after Divalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccination in an Asian Female.,Ye H||Feng H||Zhao P||Fei P,"SIGNIFICANCE: Vaccine-associated uveitis has appeared in recent years because of various vaccines, whereas cases for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination were rarely reported. With more and more females becoming aware of its importance and choosing HPV vaccination, much more attention should be paid on the adverse effects of it. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report a rare case of posterior uveitis after divalent HPV vaccination in an Asian female. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old woman presented with acute vision loss accompanied by symptoms of headache, tinnitus, and myalgia after the third injection of HPV vaccination. The best-corrected visual acuity dropped to 20/500 for both eyes, and optical coherence tomography revealed bilateral multifocal submacular fluid. A short course of oral prednisone as well as Ozurdex intravitreal injection resulted in the reversal of all signs and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although this case resembled Harada disease, we diagnosed it as vaccine-induced uveitis rather than coincidental autoimmune disease based on the rapid response to a short course of systemic corticosteroids. Because vaccine-induced uveitis is rare and difficult to distinguish from coincidental autoimmune disease, our case reminds eye care providers to be aware of the possible association between vaccination and a Harada-like reaction and to ask appropriately directed questions when obtaining history from young patients with uveitis. Based on this case, we also suggest Ozurdex intravitreal injection as a potential therapeutic choice, especially for patients with contraindication or personal concern to systemic corticosteroid.",2020 Jun,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of uveitis following HPV vaccination, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a case of uveitis following HPV vaccination, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

However, reports continue to emerge describing potentially life-threatening adverse events such as Fournier's gangrene and diabetic ketoacidosis associated with their use. Herein, we present a case of simultaneous Fournier's gangrene and diabetic ketoacidosis after initiation of treatment with canagliflozin. CASE REPORT A 37-year-old female with diabetes presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of left gluteal pain associated with dysuria 1 month after canagliflozin was added to her regimen. On initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Physical examination revealed suprapubic tenderness and induration in the left gluteal region extending to the perineum. Laboratory testing was significant for anion gap metabolic acidosis with the presence of serum ketones. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis revealed features suggestive of Fournier's gangrene. The patient was treated for Fournier's gangrene and diabetic ketoacidosis. Management included empirical antibiotic treatment, multiple surgical explorations with debridement as well as insulin infusion with aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient was discharged with a urinary catheter, vacuum dressing, and colostomy with instructions to start a basal bolus insulin regimen and discontinue canagliflozin. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case describing a simultaneous occurrence of Fournier's gangrene and diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

32404068,PMC7218485,Pisa syndrome induced by switching of a choline-esterase inhibitor treatment from donepezil to galantamine: a case report.,Mimura Y||Kurose S||Takata T||Tabuchi H||Mimura M||Funayama M,"BACKGROUND: Pisa syndrome (PS) is characterized by an abnormally sustained posture, with flexion of the body and head to one side and slight rotation of the trunk. Although PS most commonly arises as an adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs, choline-esterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are also sometimes known to induce PS. Despite the fact that the precise mechanism remains unclear, cholinergic-dopaminergic imbalance has been considered as a possible pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the genesis of PS. CASE PRESENTATION: We hereby report the case of a 60-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease who presented with the signs of PS after her treatment was switched to galantamine, a type of ChEI, even though she had received donepezil, another type of ChEI, for 5 years without any complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PS associated with treatment switch from one to another type of ChEI. Galantamine, but not other ChEIs, can enhance striatal dopamine release through allosteric modulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and has weaker muscarinic effects than donepezil. Therefore, we propose two novel hypotheses to explain the development of PS, as follows; galantamine, which enhances dopamine release, can induce imbalance of dopamine levels in the striatum of patients with dementia, resulting in PS, and the weaker muscarinic effects of the drug could be one of the factors predisposing to the development of PS. CONCLUSION: The present case suggests that treatment with galantamine is associated with a higher risk of development of PS than that with other ChEIs, such as donepezil, despite the pharmacological profile of galantamine as a dopamine modulator. Also, this report provides novel insight into another plausible mechanism underlying the development of PS, besides cholinergic-dopaminergic imbalance, namely, dopamine imbalance in the striatum with muscarinic-nicotinic imbalance.",2020 May 13,20200513.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case report of Pisa syndrome related to a change in cholinesterase inhibitor medication.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case report of Pisa syndrome related to a change in cholinesterase inhibitor medication.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses Pisa syndrome induced by a switch in choline-esterase inhibitor treatment, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses Pisa syndrome induced by a switch in choline-esterase inhibitor treatment, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,
32401725,,Psychosocial Impact of Atopic Dermatitis in Adults: A Qualitative Study.,Marron SE||Cebrian-Rodriguez J||Alcalde-Herrero VM||Garcia-Latasa de Aranibar FJ||Tomas-Aragones L,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atopic dermatitis affects a patient's quality of life in many ways. Analysis of the effects of this disease on the lives of adult patients is therefore important for the purpose of better defining their care needs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We interviewed 14 adult patients with atopic dermatitis in this qualitative study. The interviews were semistructured according to a simple outline to allow for completeness and flexibility and afford greater depth and richness of information. RESULTS: Atopic dermatitis affected the patients' lives in 6 spheres of activity: economic, occupational, personal, psychosocial, clinical, and relational. A clear finding was that the disease has a considerable psychosocial effect on adult patients, altering their interpersonal relationships and leading to rejection, stigmatization, and social isolation. It limits the patient in various spheres of life and in activities of daily living, causing sleep alterations among other effects.

The management of anesthesia in patients with BMD is complicated because they are highly sensitive to the conventional anesthetics such as volatile anesthetics and muscle relaxants. It is reported that anesthesia in patients with DMD is associated with several complications. However, a few case reports have been published on adult patients with BMD undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. Reports indicate that children with BMD may experience some serious complications with flurane-inhaled anesthesia. However, no study has yet shown that the use of flurane-induced anesthesia in adults with DMD carries high risks. PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe a 56-year-old woman with BMD who was scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy under general anesthesia due to a mass in the uterus. The patient was diagnosed with BMD 20 years back and reported that during this period, she was able to walk slowly with help during her daily life. Additionally, she also had a history of hypertension since 4 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus since 2 years. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was postmenopausal and presented with abnormal uterine bleeding and elevated CA125. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlargement of the uterus and hypoechoic internal echoes. These findings were suggestive of diffuse adenomyosis with multiple uterine leiomyomas, which would have adverse effects later in her life. Therefore, the patient required surgery to address the symptoms and further confirm the diagnosis. The final diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological analysis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. Anesthesia was induced and maintained by a combination of intravenous and inhalation anesthetic agents, particularly cisatracurium besilate and inhaled. sevoflurane. OUTCOMES: The duration of anesthesia and postoperative period were uneventful. At the end of the operation, the patient had normal vital signs and was fully conscious. The patient was followed up for 8 months and no complications were noted during this period. LESSONS: The combination of sevoflurane and cisatracurium besilate is a safe and effective method for the anesthetic management of adult patients with BMD scheduled for laparoscopic gynecological surgery. On the other hand, it is important to be aware of even rare complications of procedures, so that necessary precautions can be undertaken. Further investigations are necessary to determine the safe dosage of volatile anesthetics specifically for this clinical scenario so that anesthesiologists can use this combination method more accurately and precisely.",2020 Apr,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the management of anesthesia in a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the management of anesthesia in a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

32080100,PMC7034745,Pulmonary edema following diuretic therapy: A case report.,Liu L||Zhang Q||Zhang T||Wu X||Sun L||Li B||Wang X||Chao Y||Hu Z,"INTRODUCTION: Diuretics are a commonly used for the treatment of acute pulmonary edema. However, inappropriate administration of diuretic drugs can result in clinical treatment failure and cause acute pulmonary edema. This is due to rapid decreases in intravascular volume as a result of diuretic treatment. To date, the clinical phenomenon of inappropriate use of diuretics leading to acute pulmonary edema remains unexplored and unrecognized. Here, we report the first case of this problem-pulmonary edema following diuretic therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old male patient who was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure was initially diagnosed with pneumonia as a complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). After treatments including antibiotics, lung protective ventilation strategies, and restrictive fluid management, his respiratory symptoms improved. However, the patient's dyspnea became more severe after experimental diuretic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: A point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) examination showed increased extravascular lung water retention during a hypovolemic state. After full examinations and analysis, the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema was determined. INTERVENTIONS: The most likely cause of acute pulmonary edema was left ventricular (LV) hyperdynamic status due to a hypovolemic status caused by excessive diuretic therapy. Consequently, we administrated intravenous fluids and a beta-receptor blocker to the patient. OUTCOMES: Following these treatment, the patient's respiratory distress improved remarkably. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of pulmonary edema following diuretic therapy to stress the need of physicians to follow guidelines of clinical practice. Maintaining an appropriate volume status and treatment of beta-receptor blockers is the key to reversing the progress of this adverse effect. In this process, POCUS is a reliable diagnostic tool to identify the cause of acute pulmonary edema and can increase the accuracy of clinical evaluations. It is likely that a wider use of POCUS will help physicians to obtain a faster, and more accurate, diagnosis of the etiology of acute pulmonary edema, thus allowing a more appropriate therapy.",2020 Feb,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of pulmonary edema following diuretic therapy, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of pulmonary edema following diuretic therapy, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

We report a case of portal vein arterialization (PVA) with anastomosis of the recipient common hepatic artery (CHA) and a graft of the round ligament to achieve intrahepatic arterial flow. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man had a medical history of decompensated liver cirrhosis secondary to cholestatic liver disease owing to biliary anastomotic stricture after living donor liver transplantation and end-stage renal failure. He underwent deceased donor liver and renal transplantation with anastomosis of the recipient proper hepatic artery and the graft CHA. He experience symptoms from HAO on postoperative day 23 and underwent emergency surgery to re-anastomose the hepatic artery. Despite several instances of re-anastomoses, intrahepatic arterial flow was not able to be achieved and therefore PVA with anastomosis of the recipient CHA and the graft round ligament was performed. Although liver enzyme levels rapidly declined after surgery and the finding of liver infarction was not observed, a large amount of watery stool was observed owing to portal hypertension, which was an adverse effect of PVA. As enhanced computed tomography on POD 31 showed a pseudoaneurysm of the anastomotic site, occlusion with coils was performed to arrest hemorrhage, and a contrast study after coil occlusion showed intrahepatic arterial blood flow via collateral arteries. Thereafter, the patient needed treatment for ischemic biliary duct stenosis and was discharged home on POD 98.

31926948,,Clinical and Morphological Characteristics of Anti-Programmed Death Ligand 1-Associated Retinopathy: Expanding the Spectrum of Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy.,Ramtohul P||Freund KB,"PURPOSE: Immunotherapy with atezolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) axis, has shown promising results for the treatment of certain metastatic cancers. Atezolizumab-associated acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) with retinal venulitis is a newly reported immune-related adverse event (irAE) that further expands the range of adverse effects associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We describe the clinical course and imaging findings of a similar AMN-like retinopathy after treatment with atezolizumab. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Three patients treated with atezolizumab for metastatic breast cancer (n = 1) and non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 2). METHODS: Inclusion criterion was a clinical diagnosis of AMN-like retinopathy with or without retinal vasculitis after atezolizumab administration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical course and multimodal retinal imaging including color photographs, spectral-domain OCT, near-infrared reflectance, and fluorescein angiography were investigated. RESULTS: Three patients (1 woman and 2 men; mean age, 51 years) experienced the acute onset of reduced visual acuity and paracentral scotomas 2 weeks after their first infusion of atezolizumab. Visual symptoms corresponded to focal areas of pericentral photoreceptor disruption in all cases. In 1 patient imaged with fluorescein angiography, focal segments of retinal venulitis were detected. After treatment cessation, incomplete visual recovery was related to persistent photoreceptor damage. All patients died of their cancer within 6 months after the onset of retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, there are 3 previously published cases of atezolizumab-associated AMN with retinal vasculitis.

31926637,,From a pressure-guided to a perfusion-centered resuscitation strategy in septic shock: Critical literature review and illustrative case.,Gazmuri RJ||de Gomez CA,"PURPOSE: To support a paradigm shift in the management of septic shock from pressure-guided to perfusion-centered, expected to improve outcome while reducing adverse effects from vasopressor therapy and aggressive fluid resuscitation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Critical review of the literature cited in support of vasopressor use to achieve a predefined mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg and review of pertinent clinical trials and studies enabling deeper understanding of the hemodynamic pathophysiology supportive of a perfusion-centered approach, accompanied by an illustrative case. RESULTS: Review of the literature cited by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign revealed lack of controlled clinical trials supporting outcome benefits from vasopressors. Additional literature review revealed adverse effects associated with vasopressors and worsened outcome in some studies. Vasopressors increase MAP primarily by peripheral vasoconstriction and in occasions by a modest increase in cardiac output when using norepinephrine. Thus, achieving the recommended MAP of 65 mmHg using vasopressors should not be presumed indicative that organ perfusion has been restored. It may instead create a false sense of hemodynamic stability hampering shock resolution. CONCLUSIONS: We propose focusing the hemodynamic management of septic shock on reversing organ hypoperfusion instead of attaining a predefined MAP target as the key strategy for improving outcome.",2020 Apr,20200108.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Its use is commonly associated with a number of side effects, such as hemorrhagic diathesis, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, increased serum alanine aminotransferase, decreased serum glucose, increased serum bilirubin, decreased serum phosphate and magnesium, fatigue, hypertension, diarrhea, anorexia, proteinuria, and hypothyroidism. Abscesses of metastases caused by pazopanib administration are rarely reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of abscesses of lung metastases related to pazopanib in a patient with metastatic renal cancer. The patient was a 53-year-old Caucasian man who developed abscesses of lung metastases during the first 3 months of treatment with pazopanib.

31920114,PMC6956597,Switching Pharmacological Treatment in Wilson Disease: Case Report and Recommendations.,Leung M||Wu Lanzafame J||Medici V,"Background. Available treatments for Wilson disease (WD) prevent longterm complications of copper accumulation. Current anti-copper agents include zinc salts, penicillamine, and trientine. Patients with WD may switch between the agents for a number of reasons. Due to the different mechanisms of action between the copper chelators and zinc salts, transitioning could require a period of overlap and increased monitoring. There are no large studies that investigate the best transition strategies between agents. In this article, we review the treatments for WD and how to monitor for treatment efficacy. Case Summary. The patient had been diagnosed with WD for over 20 years prior to establishing care in our Hepatology Clinic. During his initial course, he was transitioned from penicillamine to zinc due to evidence suggesting penicillamine had greater adverse effects in the long term. Later, he was switched to trientine. His liver enzymes and 24-hour urine copper were monitored. During these years, he intermittently had some financial hardship, requiring him to be on penicillamine rather than trientine. He also had developed acute kidney injury. Overall, his liver disease remained under control and he never had signs of decompensated cirrhosis, but had fluctuations of liver enzymes over the years. Conclusion. Anti-copper treatment for WD has to be tailored to medication side effects profile, patient's chronic and emerging comorbidities, as well as costs. Transitioning regimens is often challenging, and it requires closer monitoring, with no predictors of response.",2020 Jan-Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on Wilson disease treatment, not COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on Wilson disease treatment, not COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses treatment strategies for Wilson disease and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses treatment strategies for Wilson disease and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
31911020,,Bupropion Overdose Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock Requiring Vasopressor Support and Lipid Emulsion Therapy.,Herrman NWC||Kalisieski MJ||Fung C,"BACKGROUND: Bupropion overdose is a commonly encountered presentation in the emergency department (ED). While the majority of cases resolve with supportive care, serious adverse effects, including seizures, cardiogenic shock, and death, can occur. Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy has been utilized for a multitude of poisonings with varying levels of success. Although a number of cases suggest the value of ILE therapy in cases of bupropion overdose, more recent data propose that its role may be overstated. CASE REPORT: A young woman presented to the ED with altered mental status complicated by seizure after bupropion overdose. She subsequently developed cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressor support. Bedside echocardiogram revealed a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). She received ILE therapy with significant improvement in both hemodynamic status and LVEF by bedside ultrasound. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Although the majority of patients presenting with bupropion overdose improve with supportive care, life-threatening sequelae are possible. ILE therapy has shown promise in a variety of different overdose situations, although the evidence in cases of bupropion poisoning has been varied, and it has traditionally been utilized as a last-line rescue modality. Based on hemodynamic parameters and bedside ultrasound, this case suggests that early initiation of ILE therapy should be considered in these cases, as the potential benefits likely outweigh the theoretical risks.",2020 Feb,20200103.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of bupropion overdose and its complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of bupropion overdose and its complications, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,

Development of eruptive nevi has increasingly been reported in association with medications, most frequently conventional immunosuppressants and biologics. Some drugs are associated with eruptive nevi through an indirect effect of their mechanism of action, whereas other drugs are directly implicated in melanocyte proliferation. In this regard, BRAF inhibitors have been demonstrated to activate the MAPK pathway, and to promote cellular proliferation and survival, therefore leading to the development of new melanocytic nevi and to an increase in the size and hyperpigmentation of pre-existing nevi.

The aim of this study was to determine any unknown long-term effect of C7TG supplementation on the nutritional status, body composition, resting energy expenditure and biochemical parameters of two siblings with APBD.Methods: Two adult siblings with APBD were treated over a 2-year period with a high fat, low carbohydrate diet, with C7TG oil representing about 30% of the daily caloric intake. We carried out a long-term longitudinal study to determine weight, height, waist circumference; total, intra and extra cellular water by bioimpedance; body fat, lean mass, and bone mineral density by DEXA; resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimeter; glucose and lipid profiles.Results: C7TG supplementation failed to prevent APBD progression, corroborating recent literature. However, long-term C7TG supplementation did not produce any appreciable changes in nutritional status, body composition, resting energy expenditure or biochemical parameters, and no evidence was found of potential adverse effects.Conclusions: Our data suggest that maintenance of C7TG over a 2-year period still leaves a good safety profile in terms of nutritional status, body composition, resting energy expenditure, and biochemical parameters.

31852575,,G-LOC Due to the Push-Pull Effect in a Fatal F-16 Mishap.,Metzler MM,"BACKGROUND: The risks associated with high positive G(z) (+G(z)) aerobatic flight, especially with respect to +G(z)-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC), are well known. Less appreciated is the effect of negative G(z) (-G(z)) flight on subsequent +G(z) maneuvers, known as the ""push-pull effect."" This is an example involving the loss of an F-16 and pilot that was caused by the push-pull effect.CASE REPORT: The mishap pilot (MP) was killed during a training flight when his F-16 crashed without an ejection attempt. The MP, while transitioning from prolonged -G(z) flight to sustained +G(z) flight, maneuvered the mishap aircraft (MA) from -2.06 G(z) to +8.56 G(z) in less than 5 s. At this point, there were only minimal control inputs for 5 s, indicating the MP experienced transient incapacitation, most likely due to G-LOC or almost loss of consciousness (A-LOC). The MP's subsequent recovery attempt was interrupted by ground impact. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) concluded the MP experienced G-LOC due to the push-pull effect.DISCUSSION: Since this is not the first time the push-pull effect has resulted in G-LOC mishaps, the adverse effects of such maneuvers should continue to be emphasized during military physiological training, as well as during general aviation (GA) aerobatics training. Furthermore, A-LOC, instead of being considered a discrete phenomenon, may need to be included in a broader G-LOC definition that encompasses the entire continuum of G-LOC and A-LOC.Metzler MM.

31819972,,A Case of Serum Sickness-Like Reaction in an Adult Treated with Omalizumab.,Weiss SL||Smith DM,"Omalizumab has been safely used to treat asthma and urticaria. We report a case of serum sickness-like reaction in a patient treated with omalizumab for chronic idiopathic urticaria/angioedema. An adult female experienced episodic urticaria/angioedema without repeatable trigger, ultimately receiving diagnosis of chronic idiopathic urticaria/angioedema. After initial treatment, attempts with escalating cetirizine and montelukast doses were unsuccessful due to sedation; she began treatment with subcutaneous omalizumab 150 mg monthly. Urticaria frequency partially improved after two injections; therefore, the dose was increased to 300 mg after four treatments. Several days after first 300 mg dose, she reported abdominal cramping, fatigue, fever, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia. Aside from mild thrombocytosis, inflammatory markers were unremarkable, as were evaluations for infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Omalizumab was held with eventual improvement in symptoms, which did not return after discontinuation. Omalizumab is a helpful medication in treating atopic conditions, with at least theoretical risk of immune complex formation and tissue deposition causing serum sickness-like reaction. Although early publications showed very low adverse event rates, there have now been reports of serum sickness-like reactions in children and adults treated for asthma and urticaria. Determining true incidence is difficult, given rarity and non-specific nature. Previous reports described symptoms with initiation of medication, reproducible after reintroduction. While it remains to be determined which factors increase risk for serum sickness-like reaction to omalizumab, our report of an urticaria patient who exhibited symptoms with increasing dose contributes insight into the discussion regarding this adverse effect of an otherwise well-tolerated and important medication.",2020 Jun 8,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.

Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in immunocompromised patient can cause a severe disease. Thus, we presented a case who had recurrent CMV colitis which complicate with rectovaginal fistula. METHODS: We present a case of everolimus-associated cytomegalovirus colitis on a patient receiving everolimus and exemestane therapy for the treatment of metastasized breast cancer. RESULTS: The patient presented septic shock and acute peritonitis at first. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. However, only edematous changes were observed over the terminal ileum, sigmoid colon and rectum. Four weeks after operation, we found feces coming out from her vagina. Colonoscopy was done and revealed rectovaginal fistula. Colonic and rectal mucosa moderate inflammation with multiple ulcer was also noted. Biopsy was done and the pathology proved CMV colitis. After treatment with ganciclovir, her symptoms improved. Everolimus was stopped for 12 weeks and was added back with a decreasing dose paradigm for breast cancer treatment. However, another episode of CMV colitis occurred again after resuming the everolimus. After anti-virus treatment, she was discharged. Due to adverse effects, everolimus therapy was discontinued. CONCLUSION: The standard treatment of hormone receptor positive and HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer is everolimus together with exemestane. Due to the immunosuppressive effects of everolimus, the medication may cause invasive fungal infection or other opportunistic infections. Such infections are serious and may even be fatal.

These adverse effects led to a thorough clinical investigation and eventually the discovery of a brain tumor. In the article, we hypothesize about the possible interaction between the intracranial mass and ECT and provide a literature overview on the topic. Cases like this are likely underreported, and although several studies demonstrate that ECT can be applied safely to patients with an intracranial mass, this report demonstrates that brain tumor can interfere with ECT in an unpredictable way and have severe consequences (eg, unresponsiveness to diazepam when attempting to halt the seizure as our patient).

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 68-year-old man with a history of radiation-induced high-grade metastatic mediastinal leiomyosarcoma, on pazopanib 600 mg daily, presented with a superior retinal tear 2 months after initiating pazopanib. The patient was treated with pars plana vitrectomy and endolaser retinopexy without any immediate complications. One month postoperatively, the patient was found to have a new superior macula-sparing rhegmatogenous retinal detachment extending through the laser barricade nasally. A large proportion of the laser lesions in this area had notably remained chalk-white. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckling, and repeat endolaser retinopexy. Pazopanib therapy was stopped 1 week later in consultation with the oncology team and was reinitiated after the retina seemed stable under silicone oil for several weeks. The scars from the patient's repeat endolaser retinopexy remained pale white at his clinic visit 2 months after the procedure, and at that time, his initial laser scars had only just begun to darken with pigment. Four and a half months after the initial vitrectomy and endolaser retinopexy, and three and a half months after his repeat vitrectomy and endolaser retinopexy, all the patient's laser scars have developed increased pigment, and his retina remains completely flat under silicone oil tamponade. CONCLUSION: Pazopanib may have had an adverse effect on retinal wound healing after vitrectomy with endolaser retinopexy, leading to persistence of pale laser lesions many weeks after laser application. It is possible that this may have impaired the typical development of chorioretinal laser scar formation and led to subsequent retinal detachment.",2021 Nov 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the effects of pazopanib therapy on retinal wound healing.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on the effects of pazopanib therapy on retinal wound healing.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of failed laser retinopexy in a patient undergoing pazopanib therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of failed laser retinopexy in a patient undergoing pazopanib therapy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,
30066627,,Recovery of Renal Function in a Kidney Transplant Patient After Receiving Hemodialysis for 4 Months.,Tsai JL||Tsai SF,"Renal transplant is the preferred choice of treatment for end-stage renal diseases. To avoid rejection, increasingly potent immunosuppressants are administered to recipients of kidney transplants. Complications, when there is excess immunosuppression, include possible lethal infections, which reduce allograft survival and compromise patient survival. When there is insufficient immunosuppression, rejections could impair allograft outcomes. Moreover, recurrent primary diseases could also threaten allograft outcomes. Here, we report a case of a patient who underwent ABO-incompatible and living-related renal transplant in which the patient experienced 7 acute kidney injury episodes, including recurrent malignant hypertension, rejection, and infections. After the patient underwent 4 months of hemodialysis (with serum creatinine level of 17 mg/dL), which was later terminated, no adverse effects were found for 1 year (serum creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL). Therefore, renal function recovery may be longer in patients with renovascular diseases with hypertension. For recipients undergoing hemodialysis with allograft failure, we suggest that the treatment should be not completely withdrawn of immunosuppressants so that acute kidney injuries are minimized. Even after prolonged hemodialysis (eg, for 4 months), recipients may still be able to recover renal function.",2020 Feb,20180731.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not meet the criteria because it discusses a kidney transplant patient and does not relate to COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}",The article does not meet the criteria because it discusses a kidney transplant patient and does not relate to COVID-19 vaccination.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to kidney transplant and hemodialysis, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to kidney transplant and hemodialysis, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specific focus of the scoring task.",2,90,,

33435825,,Delayed immune thrombocytopenia after discontinuation of nivolumab therapy: A case report and literature review.,Fu S||Wang T||Xu F,"INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab, a programmed death-1(PD-1) inhibitor antibody, have demonstrated anti-tumor activity for multiple malignancies. Such immune checkpoint inhibitors induce novel and distinctive adverse effects, which are collectively named immune-related adverse events. Immune-related adverse events can theoretically occur at any part of the body, including the haemopoietic system. Most immune-related adverse events developed within 10 weeks of receiving immunotherapy. Thus far, there is no report of immune thrombocytopenia as an immune-related adverse event developed after discontinuation of immunotherapy. CASE REPORT: We describe a 62-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer developed immune thrombocytopenia nearly two months after discontinuation of nivolumab. When thrombocytopenia was detected, the patient was undergoing radiotherapy of supraclavicular lymph nodes. After complex diagnosis-by-exclusion process, nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia was diagnosed. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Intravenous immunoglobulins 20 g daily for 5 days, intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg daily for 14 days followed by oral prednisone, intermittent platelet transfusion and oral thrombopoietin receptor (eltrombopag 25 mg daily) were administered. After 30 days, his platelet count had achieved a level of adequate hemostasis and continued to improvement during the tapering period. DISCUSSION: Most immune-related developed 6 months of immunotherapy. Clinicians need to be aware of a clinical diagnostic complex, developing months to years after discontinuation of immunotherapy, which recently is termed delayed immune-related events. This case is the first report of immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced thrombocytopenia that developed nearly 2 months after discontinuation of treatment with nivolumab for metastatic NSCLC.

33422175,,Eosinophilic Fasciitis - Clinical Features and Therapeutic Management.,Bilewicz-Stebel M||Bergler-Czop B||Stebel R||Werynska-Kalemba M||Matuszewska A,"Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare disease from the group of scleroderma-like connective tissue diseases with unclear etiopathogenesis. It may be occasionally accompanied with other eosinophilic or autoimmune dysfunctions (1,2). Lack of international diagnostic criteria and treatment consensus may lead to diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. The 61-year-old man with no significant personal or family pathological history was admitted to the Dermatology Department presenting persistent induration for several months as well as erythema and pain of the shins that gradually extended to thighs and forearms, with limited mobility of peripheral joints. (Figure 1) Additional tests showed leukocytosis with 16% eosinophilia, elevated CRP, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies (classes IgM and IgG) were negative twice. A biopsy that included deep fascia was taken for histopathological examination. Antinuclear antibody screening was negative, but the direct immunofluorescence showed complexes in the dermo-epidermal junction and around the vessels. The diagnostics conducted toward malignant process showed no disturbing abnormalities (i.e. tumor markers in serum, chest, and abdomen computed tomography imaging, panendoscopy). The treatment was carried out with cephalosporin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The condition did not improve much but was stable. Histopathological results were indicative of eosinophilic fasciitis with fibrous thickening of deep fascia and perivascular infiltrations of plasma cells and lymphocytes; oral prednisone was initiated and the condition begin to improve. After 12 weeks, we observed disease progression with fever and very hard and cyanic skin lesions, which presented as an orange peel with linear furrows over the superficial venous vessels (Figure 2). The lesions extended to the trunk and caused troubles in moving. A complex rehabilitative intervention was started to minimize the inflammatory fascial restrictions. The prednisolone dose was increased, and oral methotrexate was added. After two weeks, the patient suffered from abdominal pain and periodic bleeding diarrhea. Methotrexate was suspected of inducing gastrointestinal adverse effects, and antipyretic NSAIDs were completely withdrawn. Colonoscopy showed features of mucosal edema with erythema, and histopathological examination revealed eosinophilic colitis. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist, and methotrexate was ceased and switched to azathioprine. In summary, the consensus therapy of the rheumatologist, dermatologist, and gastroenterologist consisted of prednisolone and azathioprine. As of this writing, the patient's condition is gradually improving. The most characteristic symptoms of eosinophilic fasciitis is sudden onset with induration, sclerosis, and pain of the skin, with subcutaneous tissue and fascia usually appearing on the upper and lower limbs (3,4). The skin surface forms a characteristic orange peel appearance. The ""groove"" sign refers to the linear furrows over the superficial vessels of the extremities (1). Typical abnormalities are eosinophilia, elevated CRP, and hypergammaglobulinemia. The presence of eosinophilia is the most characteristic feature, occurring in 60-93% cases, but it is not necessary for diagnosis (1,5). Antinuclear antibodies are commonly absent with positive lesional direct immunofluorescence (6). If antinuclear antibodies are positive, it is recommended to broaden the diagnostic process to include other connective tissue diseases. Eosinophilia must be differentiated from hematological disorders and paraneoplastic syndrome. (4,6). Eosinophilic colitis is an eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID). It is the least frequent manifestation of EGID. It may be associated with connective tissue diseases, mostly systemic sclerosis - to our knowledge, there is no information in the literature about coexisting eosinophilic fasciitis. (7,8). The case described herein demonstrated that such a connection may occur. In treatment, it is important to prevent the patient from contractures and to maintain joint mobility by appropriate physiotherapy (2,9). The fascia forms a functional integral and continuous structure. Inflammation of one part of it changes the elasticity of the whole and produces fascial restrictions with movement limitation and pain. The fascia is profusely innervated, which favors constriction as a result of inflammation, and is also poorly vascularized which disrupts its regeneration (9,10). Myofascial techniques improve fascia elasticity by breaking up the tissue adhesions caused by inflammation (11). Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare clinical entity, but knowing the possible clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities should help in taking the appropriate diagnostic path. It is important to treat the patient with attention to all concomitant diseases in consultation with different specialists.",2020 Dec,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses eosinophilic fasciitis and its clinical features and management, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses eosinophilic fasciitis and its clinical features and management, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, which is the specified focus for scoring.",2,95,,

In addition to differences in demographic, histologic, and clinical characteristics, PACC has a genomic profile distinct from PDAC, with only rare mutations in TP53, KRAS, and p16 that are commonly found in PDAC. This case report presents a man aged 81 years who presented with a pancreatic body mass with peripancreatic lymph node enlargement. Biopsy of the mass showed acinar cell carcinoma. The patient underwent upfront surgical resection, followed by one cycle of adjuvant gemcitabine, with stoppage of therapy due to poor tolerance. Lower-dose gemcitabine was reintroduced after disease progression 6 months later. Nab-paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine after 6 cycles because of a continued increase in the size of peripancreatic lymph nodes.

33276288,,Myositis - A common but underreported adverse effect of osimertinib: Case series and review of the literature.,Parafianowicz P||Krishan R||Beutler BD||Islam RX||Singh T,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The development of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represented a paradigm shift in the management of lung cancer and has resulted in markedly prolonged survival. Osimertinib is a TKI that was fast-tracked by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015 and subsequently approved for the treatment of metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, despite the generally favorable outcomes associated with osimertinib, rapid development and deployment of any new drug increases the risk of unforeseen adverse effects. Post-marketing surveillance studies therefore play an important role in further elucidating the risks and benefits of novel anti-neoplastic agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe four patients with non-small cell lung cancer who developed myositis after beginning treatment with osimertinib. In addition, we review the literature on osimertinib-associated myositis. Using PubMed, the following terms were searched and relevant citations assessed: creatine phosphokinase, myositis, osimertinib, rhabdomyolysis, osimertinib, and Tagrisso. CASE PRESENTATION: Thirty-eight patients were treated with osimertinib in our community clinic. Four with non-small cell lung cancer developed myositis after beginning treatment. The onset of symptoms and/or elevation of creatine phosphokinase occurred between two weeks and eleven months after osimertinib was initiated. Alternative causes for myositis were not identified. In two patients, myositis resolved within one month of withdrawing treatment. Two other patients continued osimertinib treatment with close monitoring. CONCLUSION: Myositis is a serious and potentially underreported adverse effect of osimertinib.

33275698,PMC7727553,Managing toxicities of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Lipsky A||Lamanna N,"Inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) has revolutionized the treatment landscape for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). By targeting this critical kinase in proximal B-cell receptor signaling, BTK inhibitors (BTKis) impair cell proliferation, migration, and activation of NF-kappaB. Clinically, because indefinite inhibition is a mainstay of therapy, there is an extended period of exposure in which adverse effects can develop. Given the impressive efficacy and activity of BTKis in the treatment of patients with CLL, appropriate management of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) is of paramount importance. Here we review the BTKi landscape and present the available toxicity and safety data for each agent. The long-term toxicity profile of ibrutinib, a first-in-class inhibitor, is well characterized and includes a clinically significant incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, infection, diarrhea, arthralgias, and hypertension. Acalabrutinib, the initial second-generation BTKi to earn approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, demonstrates improved kinase selectivity for BTK, with commonly observed adverse reactions including infection, headache, and diarrhea. Mediated by both on-target inhibition of BTK and variable off-target inhibition of other kinases including interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), tyrosine-protein kinase (TEC), and endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), the toxicity profile of BTKis is closely linked to their pattern of kinase binding. Other emerging BTKis include second-generation agents with variable degrees of kinase selectivity and third-generation agents that exhibit reversible noncovalent binding to BTK. We also highlight critical considerations for the prevention and monitoring of AEs and offer practical management strategies for treatment-emergent toxicities.",2020 Dec 4,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on adverse effects of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on adverse effects of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, not on complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the management of toxicities related to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is unrelated to the complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the management of toxicities related to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is unrelated to the complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

The increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in oncodermatology is associated with the appearance of immunologic adverse effects linked to nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. CTS has not been reported in this context. A retrospective multicenter review was performed on CTSs occurring on immunotherapy and confirmed with electroneuromyography. Data were collated from patients' files. Most of the time, CTS was severe, bilateral, with a motor deficit and confirmed axonal damage on electroneuromyography. In 4 cases, it was associated with rheumatological adverse effects (arthralgia/inflammatory synovitis). The most effective treatment appeared to be general corticosteroid therapy, even at low doses (<15 mg/d), or surgery. An imputability of the CTS of these patients to immunotherapy was considered due to the unusual intensity of the symptoms and the absence of other predisposing factors (diabetes and dysthyroidism well-controlled). Its combination with other immunologic adverse effects and the efficacy of general corticosteroid therapy suggests an immunologic origin.

33081580,,Severe and prolonged hypocalcemia after a single dose of denosumab for metastatic breast cancer with diffuse bone involvement without prior calcium/vitamin D supplementations.,Uhm SJ||Hall JA||Herrington JD,"INTRODUCTION: Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody antiresorptive agent used for the treatment of bone metastasis in different cancer types, including breast cancer. Hypocalcemia is a known adverse effect of denosumab, and early supplementation plays an important role in the prevention and management of hypocalcemia. CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old female with stage IV estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with diffuse bone metastasis experienced severe, prolonged hypocalcemia following a single dose of denosumab. The patient also had several risk factors for denosumab-associated hypocalcemia. Despite not receiving additional doses of denosumab, the patient required multiple hospitalizations and outpatient infusions of calcium to resolve her symptomatic hypocalcemia.Management and outcome: Severe hypocalcemia associated with denosumab can be prevented or mitigated by recognizing the risk factors for hypocalcemia and supplementing with vitamin D/calcium. Proposed risk factors include poor renal function, hypoparathyroidism, insufficient calcium intake, and diffuse metastatic bone disease. Studies suggest that early supplementation before starting denosumab can lower this risk. DISCUSSION: Several cases of severe hypocalcemia associated with denosumab have been reported. However, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report that highlights the importance of early vitamin D/calcium supplementations for a patient with diffuse metastatic bone disease with pre-existing low levels of calcium.",2021 Jul,20201021.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses severe hypocalcemia as an adverse effect of denosumab, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses severe hypocalcemia as an adverse effect of denosumab, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for discussing complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,
33069247,PMC7568387,A case report of aortic root repair using a pericardial autograft for type A aortic dissection.,Chang Y||Guo H||Qian X||Fang F,"BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection with a dissection flap extending into the sinus segment often involves the commissures and the coronary ostia. In most cases, the intimal flap must be retained in order to restore aortic valve competence and reconstruct the coronary ostia. Residual dissection flap has the potential risks of proximal bleeding and adverse effects on long-term durability. We established a novel technique to reconstruct the aortic root using a pericardial autograft and significantly reduce remnant dissection tissues. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old female was admitted to our center with acute anterior chest pain and backache lasting about 10 h. Computed tomographic (CT) scans showed type A aortic dissection, with both coronary ostia being involved. Doppler echocardiography showed moderate aortic insufficiency. The dissection intimal flap was removed to the normal aorta wall near the annulus at the noncoronary sinus, leaving a 5 mm rim of intimal flap near the commissures and coronary ostia. Using a pericardial patch as a new aortic wall to reconstruct the root while preserving the aortic adventitia to fix and strengthen the new pericardial aortic wall. Ascending aorta and total arch replacement combined with frozen elephant trunk procedure was performed at the same time. The patient got an uneventful postoperative course. CONCLUSION: Aortic root repair with a pericardial autograft is a safe and effective technique to treat acute type A dissection involving the sinus.

While ropivacaine shows advantages of reduced cardiotoxicity and faster motor recovery compared to bupivacaine, the impact of intrathecal morphine-ropivacaine combination on postoperative recovery quality remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate this combination's effect on recovery outcomes after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 78 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery received either preservative-free intrathecal morphine 250 mug with ropivacaine 15 mg (Intrathecal group) or a sham subcutaneous saline injection (Control group). The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, opioid consumption, and adverse effects. RESULTS: The intrathecal group showed significantly higher QoR-15 scores 24 hours postoperatively compared to the control group (median [IQR]: 121 [109-128] vs 111 [102-116], p < 0.001), with improvements in pain management (p < 0.001), physical comfort (p = 0.001), and physical independence (p = 0.002). The intrathecal group had lower pain scores at rest (area under the curve 0-48 h: 66 [59-90] vs 107 [89-126], p < 0.001) and during coughing (152 [137-172] vs 191 [166-213], p < 0.001), particularly from 0.5 to 24 hours. They also required less postoperative morphine (0-48 h: 10 [6-20] vs 26 [22-36] mg, p < 0.001). While hypotension (43.6% vs 17.9%, p = 0.014) and pruritus (35.9% vs 2.6%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in the intrathecal group, but no respiratory depression occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal morphine-ropivacaine administration improves 24-hour postoperative recovery quality and provides superior pain relief after laparoscopic colorectal surgery, despite increased but manageable side effects. Further research should focus on dose optimization and comparative studies of different intrathecal local anesthetic combinations.

Recent advancements in neuroimaging, radiation therapy, and targeted systemic therapies, specifically BRAF and MEK inhibitors, have improved the management of this condition. Nevertheless, the optimal therapeutic approach for melanoma brain metastases remains a subject of ongoing debate, with no universally accepted treatment protocol. The combination of stereotactic radiosurgery with targeted therapy using encorafenib and binimetinib in patients harboring BRAF V600E mutation holds therapeutic promise but requires careful toxicity management to ensure both safety and efficacy. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old male with metastatic BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma presented with a 20 mm brain metastasis in the right occipital lobe, manifesting as acute-onset diplopia. The patient was undergoing systemic therapy with encorafenib and binimetinib for metastatic lung involvement. Brain MRI revealed a metastatic lesion with surrounding edema. To minimize the risk of overlapping toxicities, a treatment strategy was devised, combining stereotactic radiosurgery with a temporary cessation of targeted therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery was administered at a total dose of 27 Gy in three fractions, with enco-rafenib and binimetinib paused 24 hours prior to, and resumed 24 hours following, the radiosurgery. Following treatment, the patient's diplopia resolved completely, and a follow-up MRI two months later demonstrated near-total regression of the brain metastasis. At 30 months post-treatment, the patient remained free from recurrence and continued systemic therapy with excellent tolerance and no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the efficacy and safety of combining stereotactic radiosurgery with encorafenib and binimetinib for managing melanoma brain metastases with BRAF V600E mutation. This approach provided effective disease control, as evidenced by symptom resolution, near-complete regression on MRI, and sustained remission at 30 months, with no adverse effects observed.

The pathophysiological mechanisms and histopathological features of this adverse effect remain poorly documented. Case Presentation: A 69-year-old male with familial psoriasis developed respiratory symptoms after 18 months of ixekizumab therapy. His medical history included mild smoking-related interstitial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One month after treatment, he presented with cough and dyspnea. High-resolution chest CT showed bilateral ground-glass opacities, accompanied by elevated Krebs von den Lungen-6 and surfactant protein-D levels. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) revealed a fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern with granulomatous changes. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a predominance of CD4-positive cells and IL-17A-positive lymphocytes, suggesting Th17 cell involvement in the pathogenesis. The patient's condition improved following ixekizumab discontinuation. Conclusions: This case identifies distinct histopathological features in ixekizumab-induced DI-ILD, particularly the presence of granulomatous changes and Th17 cell involvement. The findings suggest that IL-17A inhibition may trigger pulmonary inflammation through Th17 cell function dysregulation.

Finerenone is a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that inhibits receptor-mediated sodium reabsorption and decreases receptor overactivation. This report describes a 35-year-old man with hypokalemia, a mass in the right adrenal gland, and a diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome with a c.1456>A heterozygous variant of the SLC12A3 gene, treated with finerenone. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old man was admitted to the affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University because of a mass in the right adrenal gland. He was in generally good condition upon admission. He was a non-smoker and non-drinker. The examination at admission led to diagnosis of severe hypokalemia. Genetic tests showed that he carried a homozygous pathogenic variant c.1456>A in SLC12A3, which can confirm the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome. Spironolactone was used to increase the blood potassium level, but after adverse effects were noted, finerenone was used, which greatly improved his blood potassium levels. CONCLUSIONS For patients with Gitelman syndrome who cannot tolerate adverse effects such as sex hormone-related adverse reactions from using non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, especially male patients, finerenone may be considered as an adjunct therapy for potassium retention and magnesium supplementation.

39447126,,Effective Management of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus with Unani Medications: A Case Report.,Nasir F||Itrat M||Shahabuddin F||Nikhat S,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus (DM) presents a formidable global health challenge, with conventional treatments often accompanied by limitations and adverse effects. Moreover, accessibility and affordability of conventional treatments remain barriers for many individuals, particularly in low-resource settings. Hence, there is a compelling need to explore alternative therapeutic modalities, such as Unani medicine, which offer the potential for effective management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) while potentially mitigating these drawbacks. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old female patient presented with symptoms including fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination, and a burning sensation in both feet. Her medical history revealed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with fasting blood glucose (FBS) levels at 276 mg/dl, postprandial blood glucose levels (PPBS) at 380 mg/dl, and a glycated haemoglobin percentage (HbA1c) of 11.2%. Initially prescribed with a combination of glimepiride (1mg) and metformin (500mg) twice daily, she discontinued the treatment due to discomfort. The patient was diagnosed with Dhayabῑtus Shakari and subsequently treated with Unani medications including Qurs Ziabetus (tablets), Zulal Ziabetus (decant), Safoof Darchini (powder), and Arq Zeera (distillate), commonly used in Unani Medicine for T2DM. Additionally, she received dietary recommendations and was advised to engage in a daily 30-minute walk. The patient underwent follow-up assessments every 2 weeks for a total of 12 weeks. Over this period, the patient exhibited positive responses to treatment, evidenced by notable improvements in glycaemic control. Specifically, fasting blood glucose (FBS) levels decreased to 139 mg/dl, postprandial blood glucose (PPBS) levels dropped to 179 mg/dl, and glycated hemoglobin percentage (HbA1c) decreased to 8.7%. Additionally, there was a significant amelioration in overall symptoms, as evaluated through the Asian Diabetes Quality of Life questionnaire scores and Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom score. At baseline, the AsianDQOL score indicated poor quality of life at 47, which notably improved to 85 post-treatment, indicating a shift towards a good quality of life. Furthermore, the Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom score reduced from 3 at baseline to 0 at the conclusion of treatment, indicative of alleviated pain and burning sensation in the feet. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the potential effectiveness of Unani medications in managing T2DM, suggesting its viability as a treatment option within a comprehensive diabetes management strategy.

METHODS: We present a case of a 34-year-old pregnant woman who, after discontinuing 3DR due to side effects and poor adherence, was switched to DTG/3TC at gestational week 23. Maternal viral load (VL) and infant HIV status were monitored throughout pregnancy and a ten-month breastfeeding period. Data on pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy and the risks associated with 2DR were reviewed. RESULTS: The patient's VL remained suppressed (<20 copies/mL) from gestational week 23 until the end of the breastfeeding period. A healthy HIV-negative baby was born at 39 weeks, and the child remained HIV-negative after ten months of breastfeeding. The 2DR was well-tolerated, improved adherence, and reduced fetal drug exposure. Despite limited experience with 2DR in pregnancy, no viral rebound occurred, and no adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although 3DR remains the preferred therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding, this case indicates that DTG/3TC may be an effective alternative for patients experiencing intolerance or poor adherence to 3DR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial consisted of two cohorts. In cohort 1, 45 women aged 18-65 years undergoing hysteroscopy were randomly assigned to either group E (esketamine + propofol) or group A (alfentanil + propofol). Dixon's up-and-down method was used to determine the ED95 of esketamine and alfentanil. In cohort 2, 86 patients were randomized to group E and group A, with the calculated ED95 dose of the study drugs used for induction. The success rate of anesthesia using the ED95% dose, along with parameters related to anesthesia induction, recovery, and adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: The ED95 of esketamine was 0.254 mg/kg (95% CI: 0.214-1.004), while that of alfentanil was 9.121 mug/kg (95% CI: 8.479-13.364). The anesthesia success rate was 93.0% in group E and 95.2% in group A (p = 0.664). After resuscitation, both groups achieved a 100% success rate. The induction time was significantly shorter in group E (60.0 [55.0-70.0] s) compared to group A (67.0 [61.0-79.3] s) (p = 0.006). Group E had lower rates of respiratory depression (p < 0.001), hypoxia (p = 0.006), minimum perioperative SpO(2) (p = 0.010), and hypotension (p = 0.001). Esketamine had less effect on respiratory rate, heart rate, mean blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide compared to alfentanil (all p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in postoperative pain between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study determined the ED 95 dose of esketamine for intravenous general anesthesia during hysteroscopy. Esketamine showed less respiratory and hemodynamic depression, as well as fewer adverse effects compared to alfentanil. Esketamine is an ideal anesthetic agent compared to alfentanil for hysteroscopic anesthesia.

Patients who received radiation therapy prior to modern advances, such as computer-based tumor targeting, volumetric planning, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, experience more acute and chronic adverse effects. Though exceedingly rare, radiation necrosis is of particular concern, as it can result in significant morbidity and mortality, including complex pelvic fistula formation and predisposition to potentially life-threatening necrotizing soft-tissue infections. CASE REPORT Here, we present a case of a 66-year-old woman with a prior history of anal SCC stage T3NxM0 who was treated with the Nigro protocol. Her treatment course was complicated by radiation proctitis, necessitating fecal diversion and ureteral strictures, requiring frequent stent exchanges. She presented 18 years after her cancer treatment, with widespread necrosis of her pelvic organs and surrounding soft tissue, resulting in formation of a large pelvic ""cloaca"", with a superimposed necrotizing soft-tissue infection. She was successfully treated by expedited resuscitation, septic source control, using multiple extensive debridements, and complete urinary diversion, utilizing a multidisciplinary team. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of monitoring patients for signs of radiation toxicity, particularly in patients who received radiation prior to the latest technological advancements, as they are at increased risk of developing severe, late adverse effects decades after treatment.

Supplements are not tightly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. There are many case reports involving OTC supplement adverse effects and medication interactions, but there remains minimal clinical research regarding these subjects. Rhabdomyolysis is one interaction and adverse effect frequently documented in case reports among a variety of OTC supplements, although, to date, there is no documentation of rhabdomyolysis occurring from an interaction between the supplement Tribulus terrestris and atorvastatin. CASE REPORT A 71-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department in rhabdomyolysis with a mild transaminitis after taking the over-the-counter supplement Tribulus terrestris while on long-term atorvastatin. His rhabdomyolysis peaked at day 4 after cessation of the Tribulus and atorvastatin and aggressive fluid resuscitation with a normal saline bolus at admission followed by a D5 sodium bicarbonate drip later transitioned to a normal saline drip with subsequent down-trending of the creatinine phosphokinase levels. CONCLUSIONS Tribulus terrestris is an herbal supplement used for erectile dysfunction and energy. Recent research suggests it to be a moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitor that plays a significant role in metabolism of statin and many other commonly prescribed medications. This may put patients at increased risk of developing serious adverse effects, including rhabdomyolysis and drug-induced liver injury. Screening patients for over-the-counter supplement use and educating them on the potential risks of their use is extremely important for inpatient and outpatient healthcare professionals to avoid dangerous medication interactions.",2024 Jul 16,20240716.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of the supplement Tribulus terrestris, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of the supplement Tribulus terrestris, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
38965631,PMC11225129,Association of thrombotic microangiopathy with interferon therapy for hepatitis B: a case report.,Wei S||Mei W||Wang Y,"BACKGROUND: Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ injury. The pathological features include vascular damage that is manifested by arteriolar and capillary thrombosis with characteristic abnormalities in the endothelium and vessel wall. Thrombocytopenia is one of the common adverse effects of interferon therapy. However, a more serious but rare side effect is thrombotic microangiopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 36-year-old Asian male patient with clinical manifestations of hypertension, blurred vision, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathy. Renal biopsy showed interstitial edema with fibrosis, arteriolar thickening with vitreous changes, and epithelial podocytes segmental fusion. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed C3(+), Ig A(+) deposition in the mesangial region, which was pathologically consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy renal injury and Ig A deposition. The patient had a history of hepatitis B virus infection for more than 5 years. Lamivudine was used in the past, but the injection of long-acting interferon combined with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate was used since 2018. The comprehensive clinical investigation and laboratory examination diagnosed the condition as thrombotic microangiopathy kidney injury caused by interferon. After stopping interferon in his treatment, the patient's renal function partially recovered after three consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange treatments and follow-up treatment without immunosuppressant. The renal function of the patient remained stable.

Computational prediction techniques were then employed to identify novel epitopes, followed by the design and manufacture of patient-specific immunization peptides. In combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy, the patient received a sequence of 5 biweekly prime injections followed by 2 boost injections 2 and 5 months later. The peptides were emulsified in Montanide and the injection-site was conditioned with nivolumab and imiquimod. The combined regimen of peptide immunization and chemotherapy resulted in a notable decline in CA19-9 tumor marker levels following both prime and boost applications. Subsequent MRI assessments revealed a reduction in the size of liver metastases several months post-immunization initiation. Importantly, the patient showed and improved overall survival and reported an improved quality of life without experiencing significant treatment-related adverse effects.

CASE REPORT: This is a case of a 41-year-old woman who was taking a combination kava/kratom product throughout her pregnancy. She developed an ichthyosiform dermopathy that resolved after she stopped using the product postpartum. Her male infant had a neonatal course complicated by both neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, attributed to maternal kratom and buprenorphine use, as well as a diffuse ichthyosiform rash similar to descriptions of kava ichthyosiform dermopathy in adults. His neonatal course was complicated by Group B streptococcus and Serratia marscecens bacteremia (treated with antibiotics) and seizures (treated with lorazepam and phenobarbital). His rash resolved completely by day of life 22. At 9-month outpatient follow-up, he had no dermatologic abnormalities or rash recurrence.

38830072,,Neuromuscular Emergencies.,Albin CSW,"OBJECTIVE: This article aims to familiarize the reader with the clinical approach, diagnostic considerations, and treatment strategies for patients presenting with abrupt-onset or acutely worsening weakness due to neuromuscular disorders. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Neuromuscular weakness is often the result of an inflammatory process. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of pathologic antibodies that cause neuromuscular injury. This has allowed clinicians to make a more accurate diagnosis. Additionally, neuromuscular junction disorders and myopathies are increasingly identified as the adverse effects of novel anticancer therapies, namely immune checkpoint inhibitors. More data are being incorporated into frameworks for neuroprognostication after neuromuscular emergencies, especially for commonly encountered disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Care of patients with neuromuscular emergencies requires prompt attention to respiratory status. Once supportive measures are in place to protect the airway and facilitate effective ventilation, diagnostic considerations should hinge on appropriate neurologic localization. Aggressive immunosuppression is often required for immune-mediated neuromuscular disorders, and clinicians must be thoughtful in selecting a strategy that best aligns with each patient's risk factors and comorbidities.",2024 Jun 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The abstract does not mention COVID-19 vaccination or its complications.', 'score': 2}",The abstract does not mention COVID-19 vaccination or its complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article focuses on neuromuscular emergencies and their management, with no mention of complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article focuses on neuromuscular emergencies and their management, with no mention of complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

METHODS: We present the case of a 41-year-old male with progressive hidradenitis suppurativa, unresponsive to multiple antibiotic regimens and infliximab treatment. Due to a medication error, the patient received 300 mg of secukinumab daily for 4 days instead of weekly, totaling 1200 mg. The regional pharmacovigilance center assessed potential toxicity, and a pharmacometric analysis using a population pharmacokinetic model was performed to inform dosing adjustments. RESULTS: Clinical data indicated that the received doses were within a non-toxic range. No adverse effects were observed. Pharmacometric simulations revealed a risk of underexposure due to the dosing error. Based on these simulations, it was recommended to restart monthly secukinumab injections on day 35 after the initial dose. Measured plasma concentrations before re-administration confirmed the model's accuracy. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the crucial collaboration between clinical services, pharmacovigilance, and pharmacometrics in managing medication errors.

38814267,,Results of esketamine administration in a Greek population; A case series.,Fotiadis P||Tsalkitzi E||Dimellis D||Rantis K||Tsimpiris A||Pagkalos G,"Esketamine is a non-selective, competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the brain. Through NMDA receptor antagonism, esketamine causes a transient increase in glutamate release, leading to increases in neurotrophic signaling and restoration of synaptic function in brain regions involved in mood regulation and emotional behavior. Several randomized clinical trials have shown its effectiveness in reducing the symptoms of depression in some people, despite its short-term side effects that include mainly disorientation, dizziness, nausea, and increased blood pressure. In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the European Medicines Agency approved the use of esketamine nasal spray in combination with an oral antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression in adults. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this new therapeutic proposal in a case series of five Greek patients with treatment- resistant depression. Intranasal esketamine was administered under medical supervision in combination with an oral antidepressant. Depressive symptoms were evaluated at three time points (baseline, end of treatment, and one-year post-treatment) using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the CGI Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression (PDQ-D). Possible side effects were assessed using the Richmond Suppression Agitation Scale (RASS), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), the CADSS Disruptive States Scale, and a predefined list of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Patients followed an individualized treatment plan for seven to twelve months depending on the achievement of an adequate response. Statistical analysis of the results revealed a significant improvement (p<0.05) on all scales used. All participants maintained their level of improvement at follow-up after twelve months. Adverse effects were found to be mild and tolerable. It is worth noting that significant side effects were reported only by the two patients with comorbid personality disorder.

Pharmacotherapy is the standard treatment. However, current treatment provides only symptomatic relief and may result in adverse effects with long-term use. Treatment protocols using herbal medicines have emerged to compensate for this limitation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Asian woman visited our hospital with worsening headaches that had persisted for 30 years. Her headaches were aggravated by night-time lower-extremity discomfort. The patient was diagnosed with RLS based on the 2012 Revised International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group Diagnostic Criteria (IRIS). The patient was prescribed herbal medicines, Shihogyeji-tang, Gyejibokryeong-hwan, and Jakyakgamcho-tang, all of which contain Paeoniae Radix. Fourteen days after starting herbal medicine treatment, the IRIS score decreased from 30 to 18. The patient experienced less leg discomfort. Moreover, her sleep time increased, and her headaches resolved. After 28 days of herbal treatment, the IRIS score decreased to 9. Importantly, the patient reported no sleep disturbance or headaches. Subsequently, conventional medications were discontinued. The patient remained stable (IRIS score: 9-10). Herbal treatment was discontinued on day 163. At the last follow-up, (day 364), the patient has not reported any symptom recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We described a female patient with a 30-year history of RLS symptoms and related sleep disturbances that induced chronic uncontrolled headaches, who experienced improvements shortly after using herbal medicines containing Paeoniae Radix. Conventional medications were discontinued and the patient had no recurrence of symptoms.

When the primary or secondary closure of the defect is not feasible, complex procedures with graft (split-thickness or full-thickness) or flap (pedicled or free) are required. These procedures are performed by specialized plastic surgeons and are at high risk for adverse effects, even high morbidity among both the donor and acceptor sites. Furthermore, split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) often lead to unsatisfactory results in terms of mechanical stability, flexibility, and aesthetics due to the lack of underlying dermal tissue.

Case Presentation: The case was a 28-year-old Japanese woman in her first pregnancy, treated for depression with vortioxetine (20 mg daily) among other medications. At 36 weeks of gestation, she was admitted for premature rupture of the membranes and delivered a girl with no apparent congenital anomalies. Immediately after birth, the neonate required brief respiratory support due to her dyspnea and poor muscle tone. Her respiratory condition improved in 6 days after delivery, and she demonstrated normal developmental progress afterward. Maternal plasma and breast milk samples, collected 4 days postpartum, revealed vortioxetine concentrations of 11.4 ng/mL and 9.3 ng/mL, respectively. The calculated relative infant dose (RID) was estimated at 0.32%. After discharge from hospital, the infant presented no detectable drug-related adverse effects, with over 50% of nutrition derived from breastfeeding. Conclusion: This case showed minimal transfer of vortioxetine into breast milk, reflected in a low RID. The findings suggest limited neonatal exposure to the drug, with no adverse developmental effects observed in the infant. However, the case also indicated the potential for vortioxetine use during pregnancy to contribute to the onset of severe neonatal asphyxia.

38698617,PMC11075376,Excimer Laser Therapy for Pigmented Purpuric Dermatosis: A Case Study.,Myers H||Ceci FM||Rupley K||Roberts M,"BACKGROUND Pigmented purpuric dermatosis (PPD) is a rare disease that is poorly understood but thought to result from inflammation of the capillaries causing extravasation of erythrocytes into the soft tissue. There are a variety of potential causes, including medications, such as acetaminophen and aspirin, abnormal humoral immunity, and excessive exercise. Although benign, PPD can be bothersome to patients due to associated pruritus, weeping, and poor cosmetic results. Treatment of this lesion is difficult, with no standardized regimen and a tendency for relapse once treatment is discontinued. CASE REPORT This case reports on a 77-year-old man who presented to an outpatient dermatology clinic with bilateral lower extremity edema with associated weeping and erythema for 1 year. A biopsy was conducted and resulted as PPD. He began treatment with excimer laser therapy after conservative and topical treatment options failed, with resolution of symptoms without recurrence for approximately 1 year. CONCLUSIONS PPD is notoriously difficult to treat, and historic treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral supplements, and immunomodulators, all of which come with a range of adverse effects. However, new literature supports the use of phototherapy to treat PPD, with varying results. Previously implemented options include but are not limited to phototherapy with psoralen plus ultraviolet A, narrow band ultraviolet B, advanced fluorescence technology pulsed light, and fractional non-ablative 1540-nm erbium: glass laser, each with varying degrees of success.

38684049,,Depression in Persons With Epilepsy: Lessons From Case Review.,Abell K||Sit DK||Wisner KL,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent among persons with epilepsy (PWEs). Between 30% and 50% of PWEs suffer from depression. Many factors contribute to this prevalence, including the psychosocial impact of the diagnosis, restrictions on driving and certain types of work, and adverse effects associated with antiseizure medications. Without proper treatment, depressed PWEs have increased risks for suicide, strained relationships, lowered seizure control, and impairment in functioning. Our objective was to use the existing literature and insights from our experience in treating depression and anxiety in PWEs within an academic mood disorders center. We aimed to provide practical guidance for health care professionals who treat depression in this population. METHODS: Persons with epilepsy and depression were identified by their treating psychiatrists. Their electronic health records were reviewed and compiled for this report, with a total of 12 included in this review. Records were reviewed regarding antiseizure medications, psychotropic medications, light therapy, psychotherapy, other interventions, and treatment response. RESULTS: Based on our review of literature, as well as review of cases of individuals with epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric conditions, we recommend a step-wise evidence-based approach of optimizing psychiatric medication doses, augmenting with additional medication and/or implementing nonpharmacological interventions such as light therapy and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: In PWEs, improvement in depression, other psychiatric symptoms, and function are the goals of drug and nondrug interventions.

We describe here the case study of a 58-year-old woman who presented with bilateral severe myopia with bilateral advanced POAG and unreached target pressure under quadritherapy, who was successfully managed by PM surgery. A review of the literature completes our observation. At presentation, the patient had a spherical equivalent of - 7.50 RE and - 7.75 LE with an IOP of 22 mmHg right and left eye (RLE) under quadritherapy, and with severe bilateral visual field loss, including scotomas within the central 5 degrees . The patient presented with systemic hypertension treated with an antihypertensive drug. Two selective laser trabeculoplasties (SLT), performed 3 months apart, were first tried on the LE, without any change in IOP at 2 months. After considering the high risk of postoperative complications, a PM operation was proposed, with a targeted IOP in the mid-fifteens RLE. The patient's eyes underwent PM surgery with mitomycin C (MMC) MMC0.2 mg/mL for 3 minutes without any complications. The LE required 2 consecutive needlings with 1 mL MMC0.2 mg/mL. At 24 months after surgery, the two eyes gave successful results without the need for any additional medical therapy, and with well-functioning conjunctival blebs. The PM was an effective alternative to the gold standard trabeculectomy in our severely myopic patient.

Clinicians frequently use fast-acting corticosteroids, which are subsequently combined with slower-acting immunosuppressants to progressively taper the corticosteroid dosage. Current research is focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against target molecules involved in the pathogenesis of PG. However, available data on their efficacy are based on sporadic case reports and clinical experiences, so the authors aimed to evaluate the efficacy of risankizumab, an anti-interleukin-23 mAb, in the management of two complex PG cases. The authors enrolled two patients with PG who were already treated with immunosuppressive therapies. Their management was based on the off-label use of an mAb directed against the p19 subunit of interleukin-23: risankizumab. Patients received subcutaneous injections of 150 mg at the start of treatment, at week 4, and then every 10 weeks thereafter. Systemic therapy was combined with local management of ulcers, based on the principles of TIME (tissue, infection, moisture balance, and epithelialization) applied to the inflammatory and noninflammatory phases of PG. Clinical resolution was obtained at week 24 for patient 1 and week 16 for patient 2 and was maintained until week 40, without adverse effects or disease recurrence.

While there are many causes of this rhythm, including electrolyte imbalances, ischemia, and genetic disorders, iatrogenic etiologies are important to recognize. Abiraterone is an androgen synthesis antagonist effective in treating prostate cancer, but here we describe a case of severe hypokalemia secondary to abiraterone resulting in polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest. While this is a potential adverse effect of the medication, severe hypokalemia causing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest, as seen in our patient's case, has not been described. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old African-American man with history of prostate cancer presents with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, he was found to be severely hypokalemic and refractory to large doses of repletion.

38591225,,Buprenorphine Enhanced Taper Tolerability Evaluation Report (BETTER): A Case Series.,Epland C||Pals H||Hayden J,"BACKGROUND: Discontinuing sublingual buprenorphine (SL-BUP) has been identified by some patients as a potential outcome of success for opioid use disorder treatment. The process of tapering SL-BUP can be lengthy as unpleasant opioid withdrawal symptoms limit the pace of dose adjustments. Uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms pose a risk for return to illicit opioid use and more patient-centered options for tapering SL-BUP are needed. Previous case reports have identified using extended-release subcutaneous buprenorphine (ER-BUP) to minimize withdrawal symptoms as the dose self-decreases very gradually. Ideal dosing strategies, appropriate patient characteristics, and duration of buprenorphine release with the ER-BUP injection are not well described. PATIENT CASES: We present 8 cases where a single 100 mg ER-BUP injection was administered to patients experiencing intolerable withdrawal symptoms during SL-BUP taper. Patients were taking between 2 and 6 mg SL-BUP daily prior to injection. Three patients experienced mild adverse effects the day after receiving injection, all of which were taking lower SL-BUP doses (2-3 mg). In the 12 months following injection, 3 patients experienced mild, but tolerable withdrawal symptoms at variable intervals. Two patients returned to taking SL-BUP and no patients returned to illicit opioid use. Buprenorphine urine toxicology showed elimination of buprenorphine occurred after 24 weeks. DISCUSSION: Findings from these cases support current evidence-based guidance that ER-BUP tapering is better tolerated than traditional SL-BUP tapering. These patient cases and pharmacokinetic modeling of ER-BUP suggest that a target preinjection dose of 2 to 6 mg SL-BUP will minimize the risk of more severe adverse effects or withdrawal symptoms. Patients and providers should ensure that remission is well-established before initiating SL-BUP taper. A shared decision-making approach can help support patient autonomy and understanding safety risks of discontinuing SL-BUP. Future prospective studies with larger populations could further refine dosing strategies with various SL-BUP preinjection doses and newer ER-BUP formulations.",2024 Oct,20240409.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on buprenorphine tapering and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on buprenorphine tapering and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of buprenorphine for tapering off opioid use, focusing on withdrawal symptoms and treatment strategies, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of buprenorphine for tapering off opioid use, focusing on withdrawal symptoms and treatment strategies, but does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

We assessed the effect of peribulbar dexamethasone or triamcinolone (40-mg Triesence), a longer-acting corticosteroid, targeting the peribulbar area as opposed to directly injecting the affected extraocular muscle. This more convenient and secure approach holds the potential for straightforward integration within clinical environments. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Five patients were identified that were treated with peribulbar corticosteroids. In 4 of the 5 cases, ophthalmoparesis was unilateral. One case had isolated ptosis, and 4 had both ptosis and ophthalmoparesis. Three of these 4 cases reported complete resolution of symptoms within weeks of a single injection.

As a source of vinblastine and vincristine used in chemotherapy, Catharanthus roseus is also employed in traditional medicine with its flower and stalks in dried form. Its toxicity can lead to various adverse effects. We report a case of Catharanthus roseus juice toxicity presenting as acute cholangitis, emphasizing the importance of healthcare providers obtaining detailed herbal supplement histories. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and lower limb numbness. Initial diagnosis of acute cholangitis was considered, but imaging excluded common bile duct stones. Further investigation revealed a history of ingesting Catharanthus roseus juice for neck pain. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient developed gastric ulcers, possibly due to alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus. No bacterial growth was noted in blood cultures. The patient recovered after discontinuing the herbal extract. CONCLUSIONS: Catharanthus roseus toxicity can manifest as fever, hepatotoxicity with cholestatic jaundice, and gastric ulcers, mimicking acute cholangitis.

This prompted a literature review of best practice guidelines for long-term management of checkpoint-inhibitor induced T1DM including oral steroids as a treatment option similar to other ICI adverse effects. DATA SOURCES AND SUMMARY: A literature search on PubMed was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of steroid treatment ICI-induced T1DM in any cancer type. Search terms consisted of ""ipilimumab"" OR ""nivolumab"" OR & ""pembrolizumab"" OR ""immune checkpoint"" AND ""diabetes"" OR ""type 1 diabetes"" AND ""cancer"" OR ""melanoma"" OR ""carcinoma OR ""sarcoma"". Inclusion criteria were case reports published after 2015 in which the patient was diagnosed with ICI-induced T1DM or diabetic ketoacidosis where oral steroids were part of the treatment. Exclusion criteria included oral steroids not used as a treatment modality for T1DM, multiple endocrine comorbidities, no response recorded, and previous history of T1DM. 284 abstracts were found with these search terms of which 33 full-text articles were concluded to be eligible and screened and from which 8 records were included.

CONCLUSION: Although the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and tacrolimus combination is not contraindicated, other treatment strategies should be considered first, if available, and the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced when using the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination. In cases where combination therapy is necessary, serum tacrolimus levels should be closely monitored in lung transplant recipients.

38483178,,Extracorporeal Photopheresis as a Treatment Option for Immune-Related Adverse Events: Two Case Reports and a Prospective Study.,Ruf T||Rahimi F||Anz D||Tufman A||Salzer S||Zierold S||Tomsitz D||French LE||Heinzerling L,"The wide use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has increased the frequency of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While many are managed with corticosteroids or hormone substitution, up to 14.9% of irAEs are steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent and thus require second-line treatment. These should reduce irAE-related morbidity and mortality and induce a few side effects of their own while maintaining the antitumor response. There is little comparative data on second-line therapies for irAEs. Two cases of irAEs could not be sufficiently managed with corticosteroids and subsequently received treatment with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), including one patient with immune-related erosive oral lichen planus and one patient with immune-related colitis. In both cases, the irAE resolved with ECP in combination with immunosuppressive drugs, that is 4 weeks and 10 weeks after the start of ECP, respectively. To investigate this approach, a prospective clinical study that compares ECP and other second-line therapies for the treatment of steroid-refractory and steroid-dependent irAEs with regard to immunophenotype and therapy response has been designed. ECP could be a treatment option for steroid-refractory and steroid-dependent irAEs, given its good safety profile and lack of adverse effects on antitumor response.

38470137,,Challenges with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist initiation: a case series of semaglutide overdose administration errors.,Wiener BG||Gnirke M||Vassallo S||Smith SW||Su MK,"BACKGROUND: Prescriptions of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist administered weekly for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are increasing. Adverse effects from semaglutide overdose are poorly described. We report adverse effects from three unintentional semaglutide overdoses upon initiation. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: A 53-year-old man unintentionally injected semaglutide 2 mg instead of the recommended 0.1 mg. Case 2: A 45-year-old woman unintentionally injected semaglutide 2.4 mg instead of 0.25 mg. Case 3: A 33-year-old woman injected semaglutide 1.7 mg. All three of these patients developed nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. No patient experienced hypoglycemia. DISCUSSION: These unintentional semaglutide overdoses occurred due to deficits in patient and prescriber knowledge, and evasion of regulated access to pharmaceuticals. Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms predominated. The potential for hypoglycemia following glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist overdose is unclear, though it did not occur in our patients. It is thought that glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia because their effects are glucose-dependent and diminish as serum glucose concentrations approach euglycemia. There is, however, an increase in hypoglycemia when glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are combined with sulfonylureas. CONCLUSIONS: This case series highlights the critical role of patient education and training upon initiation of semaglutide therapy to minimize administration errors and adverse effects from injection of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.",2024 Feb,20240312.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on semaglutide overdose, not COVID-19 vaccination complications.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on semaglutide overdose, not COVID-19 vaccination complications.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses adverse effects related to semaglutide overdose, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses adverse effects related to semaglutide overdose, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with OSSN receiving topical 1% 5-FU eye drops as a primary or adjuvant treatment between 2013 and 2021 was performed. Individuals diagnosed with punctal or canalicular stenosis during or after topical 5-FU use were included in this study. Four individuals met these criteria; we report clinical findings and treatment course for each patient. RESULTS: We reviewed 303 patients (316 eyes) with OSSN. All patients were treated with topical 1% 5-FU eye drops in cycles, given 4 times daily for 1 week with 3 weeks off. Four patients (5 eyes) developed punctal stenosis, for a frequency of 1.3%. The mean age at 5-FU initiation in the 4 individuals was 61 years (range 53-69). Most individuals were male (75%), White (75%), and non-Hispanic (100%). The most common presenting symptom of stenosis was epiphora, noted 4.6 +/- 3 months after initiating topical 5-FU (after 4.9 +/- 2.0 cycles). This occurred in 4 eyes while on therapy (3, 2, 4, and 4 months since 5-FU initiation) and in 1 eye after stopping therapy (10.3 months since 5-FU initiation). In 1 eye, punctal stenosis and epiphora resolved spontaneously after stopping 5-FU. Punctal dilation led to symptom resolution in 2 eyes. Surgical intervention (punctoplasty and external dacryocystorhinostomy) was needed in 2 eyes for punctal and canalicular stenosis, respectively.

His visual acuity was 20/60 in his right eye and no perception of light in his left eye. He was treated with multiple injections of intravitreal Ganciclovir in his right eye. The left eye was not treated since it had no vision potential. The right eye of the patient which had received multiple injections went on to developed a progressive diffuse atrophy of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). No such changes were noted in the left eye of the patient.

38273653,PMC10825706,Rapid and Effective Treatment of Peritonitis in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients with Intravenous Dalbavancin.,Tegethoff JI||Teitelbaum I||Kiser TH,"BACKGROUND Peritonitis is a complication associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD), which carries a significant morbidity and mortality risk. Empiric therapy must include coverage of gram-positive organisms; vancomycin is a recommended treatment option, particularly when MRSA infection is a risk. Vancomycin is cumbersome for patients, requiring therapeutic drug monitoring and re-administration by a healthcare provider. Dalbavancin, administered as a one-time intravenous dose, is a convenient potential treatment option for PD patients to cover gram-positive organisms without the need for routine drug monitoring. CASE REPORT We present 2 patients effectively treated with dalbavancin for infectious peritonitis. The first patient, a 73-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on PD, presented to the hospital with fever, elevated white blood cells (WBCs), and cloudy peritoneal fluid with elevated nucleated cell counts (88% neutrophils). This patient was given 1 dose of 1500 mg IV dalbavancin. Within 3 days, her fever resolved, WBCs returned to normal, and peritoneal fluid results improved. The second patient was a 36-year-old woman presenting to an outpatient clinic with abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid with elevated nucleated cell counts (53% neutrophils) treated with dalbavancin 1500 mg IV once. Within 4 days, this patient's pain had resolved, and peritoneal fluid results returned to baseline. No adverse effects were noted for either patient. CONCLUSIONS These cases illustrate the potential of dalbavancin as a convenient option for patients with PD-associated peritonitis.

However, akathisia is a very uncommon manifestation of antidepressants. Much more rarely, antidepressants are also associated with the emergence of motor and vocal tics. This case adds to the growing literature of rare adverse events induced by antidepressants and aims to stimulate future research into the mechanism and risk factors of this phenomenon. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, we describe a patient with panic disorder and co-morbid Crohn's disease who developed worsening anxiety, akathisia and vocal tics upon initiation of fluvoxamine. This is the first case report to describe the emergence of both akathisia and vocal tics in the same patient following antidepressant initiation. After discontinuation of fluvoxamine, the patient's symptoms resolved. CONCLUSION: Antidepressant-induced akathisia and tics are often distressing both to the patient and their loved ones, and can be very puzzling to the clinician.

Although cardiovascular effects including hypotension and bradycardia are common adverse effects of guanfacine, the effect of guanfacine on QT intervals remains unclear. The association between the serum concentration of guanfacine and its toxicity has also not been fully investigated. CASE REPORT: This is a case of a 21-year-old woman with ADHD who developed repeated presyncope 1 day before admission. She was taking 3 mg of extended-release guanfacine and 50 mg of sertraline. On admission, she had bradycardia and hypotension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a QT interval of 0.68 s and a QTcF interval of 0.648 s. The QT intervals were manually measured and corrected by the Fridericia formula (QTcF = QT/RR(1/3)). Although she denied taking an overdose of guanfacine and other drugs, we suspected guanfacine toxicity. The serum guanfacine concentration was 13.0 ng/mL on admission and decreased to 3.2 ng/mL on day 1 and 0.4 ng/mL on day 2.

This clinical scenario could limit the use of lofexidine at dosages reported in clinical trials of opioid withdrawal precipitated by abrupt opioid discontinuation. Thus, the primary aim of this prospective case series is to describe the use of low dose lofexidine for opioid withdrawal in patients with chronic pain undergoing medically directed opioid tapering in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Six patients (white 5, Latino 1) admitted to an outpatient interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients self-selected to undergo medically directed opioid tapering, and the medication the patients were prescribed upon admission was used in the taper schedule. Upon initiation of the opioid taper, patients received 0.18 mg of lofexidine every 6 hours. RESULTS: Five of the six patients were women, and the median morphine milligram equivalents at baseline were 36.9. The median taper duration was 15 days, and the median duration of lofexidine administration was 14 days. Withdrawal scores were mild throughout the taper in four patients, and two patients with fibromyalgia experienced single episodes of moderately severe withdrawal symptoms at the median morphine milligram equivalent midpoint of the taper. No hypotension or sustained bradycardia were observed, and no adverse effects related to lofexidine were reported.

It is associated with better tolerability compared with other antipsychotics. However, there are reports of patients who experience problem gambling, hypersexuality, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and other impulsive and/or compulsive behaviors as a result of aripiprazole administration and/or dosage increase. We aimed to do a systematic review of case reports published in this regard. After screening more than 6000 titles and abstracts in ten scientific search engines, we found 35 related records comprising 59 cases. The majority of cases (n = 42, 71.18%) were male, the mean age was 33.83 years (+/- 13.40), and the average daily dose of aripiprazole was 11.63 mg (+/- 6.94). The results of our review showed that the most frequently published impulsivity adverse effect of aripiprazole is gambling, followed by hypersexuality, obsessive-compulsive symptoms/disorder, problem eating, trichotillomania, problem shopping, and kleptomania.

It is mainly characterized by skin symptoms such as purpura, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal symptoms, and nephropathy, which are caused by IgA adherence to the vessel walls. Herein, we report the case of an advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a purpuric skin rash of the legs that developed during fourth-line chemotherapy with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S-1). CASE REPORT A 68-year-old man diagnosed with NSCLC 2 years ago was undergoing S-1 as fourth-line chemotherapy when he developed purpura and edema on the lower extremities. Biopsy renal specimens were consistent with IgA vasculitis. Considering his medical history, both IgA vasculitis induced by S-1 and a paraneoplastic syndrome were considered, although the exact cause could not be identified. Subsequently, chemotherapy was discontinued because of his deteriorating general condition, and he received optimal supportive care. The purpura spontaneously disappeared; however, his ascites and renal function deteriorated. Systemic steroids improved renal function, but the ascites did not resolve. One month after being diagnosed with IgA vasculitis, the patient died due to deterioration of his general condition. CONCLUSIONS This case emphasizes the occurrence of IgA vasculitis during lung cancer treatment and its potential impact on the disease course of lung cancer. Moreover, the possible causes of IgA vasculitis in this case were paraneoplastic syndrome or S-1 adverse effects, but further case series are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

This report aims to investigate the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of leucovorin induced HSRs. A 60-year-old female developed generalized edema, dyspnea, and facial redness during cetuximab plus FOLFOX chemotherapy administered for management of metastatic colorectal cancer. Because HSRs induced by oxaliplatin are commonly reported, we initially presumed an oxaliplatin-induced HSR. However, despite undergoing oxaliplatin desensitization, HSRs persisted, and they were still observed when leucovorin was administered without oxaliplatin. The patient was diagnosed with leucovorin-induced HSR and underwent leucovorin desensitization. However, the reactions recurred within 30 minutes of the initiating the desensitization. Considering unsuccessful leucovorin desensitization, leucovorin was excluded. The patient received cetuximab and oxaliplatin chemotherapy without leucovorin to date without any adverse effects.

This technique aims to avoid the adverse effects of RV apical pacing, which can lead to ventricular dyssynchrony and heart failure over time. CSP is gaining popularity but its long-term efficacy and challenges remain uncertain. This report discusses a case where CSP was initially successful but faced complications due to an increasing pacing threshold. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old female with total atrioventricular block was referred for brady-pacing. Due to the potential for chronic RV pacing, CSP was chosen. The CSP implantation involved subcutaneous device placement, with a CSP lead in the left bundle branch area (LBBA) and an RV backup lead. A year after successful implantation, the LBBA pacing threshold progressively increased. Subsequent efforts to correct it led to anodal capture and battery depletion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) revealed mid-septal fibrosis at the area of LBBA lead placement and suggested cardiac sarcoidosis as a possible cause. CONCLUSION: CSP is a promising technique for treating bradyarrhythmias, but this case underscores the need for vigilance in monitoring pacing thresholds. Increasing thresholds can render CSP ineffective, necessitating alternative pacing methods. The CMR findings of mid-septal fibrosis and the potential diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis emphasize the importance of pre-implantation assessment, as CSP may be compromised by underlying structural abnormalities.

The clinical uptake of rTMS has been facilitated by its relatively benign adverse-effect profile compared with other treatment modalities. Seizure is a rare but serious adverse event that has been reported with rTMS, when dosage exceeds safety guidelines or in individuals at increased risk for seizure. Fortunately, most rTMS-induced seizures are typically transient, with no adverse sequelae, but they may lead to treatment discontinuation. Seizure is not the only cause of loss of conscious and abnormal movements induced by rTMS. Convulsive syncope, a more common adverse event that involves loss of consciousness associated with myoclonic movements, can be difficult to differentiate from an rTMS-induced seizure. We report the case of a 52-year-old man with no known seizure risk factors, enrolled in an institutional review board-approved research study who developed what appeared to be a convulsive syncopal episode lasting 10 to 15 seconds during day 2 of a 30-day rTMS protocol (10 Hz, 120% of motor threshold, 4-second pulse train, 26-second intertrain interval, 3000 pulses per session), with no adverse sequelae. The patient's history, screening, physical examination, pertinent laboratory, neurology consult, electroencephalogram, and imaging findings are discussed. This case demonstrates that distinguishing between convulsive syncope and rTMS-induced seizure can be a diagnostic challenge.

38008591,,Treatment of gastric paralysis after gastric schwannoma by electroacupuncture: A case report and literature review.,Huang Y||Huang Y||Jin H||Pei X,"OBJECTIVE: We identified the potential role of electroacupuncture (EA) as an alternative therapy to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in a rare case of postoperative gastroparesis after gastric schwannoma (GS). CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old woman presented with impaired gastric emptying after gastrectomy for GS and was diagnosed with postoperative gastroparesis syndrome (PGS). The symptoms were slightly relieved after routine placement of the jejunal tube; however, symptoms such as dietary intolerance and impaired gastric emptying persisted. After the consultation, the patient agreed to undergo EA therapy. INTERVENTION AND RESULTS: The patient was able to tolerate oral intake after seven days of EA treatment, and the frequency and amount of food intake increased. The jejunal tube was removed at the outpatient follow-up two weeks after discharge, and the patient resumed a semi-liquid diet and was able to eat small amounts of rice. Reexamination of the upper digestive tract angiography showed that part of the contrast agent passed through the pyloric sinus, which showed improvement. CONCLUSION: EA stimulation increased tolerance to transoral feeding in patients with postoperative gastroparesis and facilitated the passage of contrast agents through the pyloric sinus. No adverse effects were observed during treatment, and the treatment was well accepted and tolerated by patients. A review article noted the benefits of acupuncture for gastrointestinal disorders but lacked high-quality evidence to support this.(1) Therefore, the therapeutic role of EA needs to be further elucidated to provide high-quality evidence-based medical evidence for its clinical use.",2024 Jul-Aug,20231121.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the treatment of gastric paralysis and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the treatment of gastric paralysis and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses the treatment of gastric paralysis using electroacupuncture and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The input item discusses the treatment of gastric paralysis using electroacupuncture and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
38006373,,PAPA Syndrome: Challenges in Achieving Long-Term Remission.,Smajlovic H||Prohic A,"For over two decades, the acronym PAPA syndrome has been used to describe an autoinflammatory condition caused by missense mutations in the PSTPIP1 (proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1) gene and clinically characterized by the presence of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), and acne (1,2). Due to the involvement of the PSTPIP1 gene in the regulation of innate immunity, mutations of this gene cause abnormal activation of inflammasomes, complexes of NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 proteins. As a result, production of interleukin-1beta, a key molecule that triggers synthesis of cytokines necessary for the recruitment of neutrophils, is significantly increased (2,3). Additionally, the levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and interleukin 17 (IL-7) are also elevated, which further disrupts inflammatory mechanisms in the microenvironment (4). Since hyperproduction of IL-1 and other involved cytokines is the predominant event in the pathogenesis, these molecules are promising targets in the treatment of PAPA syndrome. Corticosteroids and biologics are currently the most commonly used agents for inducing and hastening remission of symptoms (5). A substantial step forward in the treatment of PAPA syndrome has been the introduction of medications blocking the cytokines crucial in the pathogenesis of this disorder, with TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors being the most frequent choice of such biological therapy (6). We report the case of a 22-year-old male patient with PAPA syndrome who was referred to our department 18 months ago due to exacerbation of skin changes. Initial presentation and subsequent evolution of disease in this patient matched the typical clinical pattern of PAPA syndrome. The first symptoms occurred at the age of two in the form of unspecific joint disease that was diagnosed as juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Subsequently, in the early adolescence the patient presented with new skin changes manifesting as severe acne and persistent pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers. At the same time, severity of joint involvement gradually decreased. After the characteristic phenotype of the disease had fully developed, suspicion of possible syndromic origin of symptoms arose. For this reason, genetic analysis was performed as requested by attending pediatricians at the University Clinical Center in Sarajevo, and E250Q mutation of the PSTPIP1 gene was detected. Thus, the diagnosis of PAPA syndrome was confirmed. Throughout the duration of the disease, several types of medication had been introduced in the treatment with varying success. Earliest joint symptoms were alleviated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, while repeated courses of corticosteroids were the mainstay of the therapy during a decade-long period. As a consequence of prolonged steroid therapy, growth disorder, among various other side-effects, had been especially pronounced. Acting as a classic steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, methotrexate had also been part of the patient's treatment regimen. Lastly, biologics, including both TNF-alpha and IL-a inhibitors, had been separately administered as the remaining treatment options. However, adalimumab expressed a predominant effect on joint symptoms, whereas re-activation of previously undetected Hepatitis-B infection occurred during the subsequent therapy with anakinra. Due to this adverse reaction, anakinra treatment was discontinued. At the initial examination, the patient presented with multiple erythematous, partially excoriated papules and nodules, along with residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmented patches and scars on the skin of the whole back, chest, shoulders, and upper arms (Figure 1, Figure 2). The presence of postoperative scars on the elbows, resulting from previously performed surgical procedures of persistently affected joints with the goal of achieving pain relief and functional improvement, was also observed. Several smaller ulcers with undermined edges (Figure 3), as well as residual hyperpigmentation and cicatrices (Figure 4) were visible on the lower extremities. Additionally, the patient reported appearance of pustules and non-healing ulcers after minor trauma, which corresponds to the pathergy phenomenon, a common feature of PAPA syndrome. In contrast to the severity of cutaneous changes, the joint symptoms were mild. After thorough assessment of the patient's medical history and current condition, a multi-agent regimen was initiated, consisting of adalimumab, isotretinoin, and prednisone. Regular check-ups during the 12 months of treatment showed that the applied agents stabilized the patient's condition, alleviated more severe and acute skin changes, and slowed down further exacerbation of symptoms. Due to the rarity of PAPA syndrome, data on its treatment is scarce. Official guidelines are non-existing, and available information is based on case reports, case series, and a few smaller retrospective studies (5,7). In general, response to therapy remains inconsistent between patients, despite introduction of novel drugs. Furthermore, single treatment regimens are often not equally effective for all manifestations of the disease, which in a number of cases results in the administration of multi-agent treatment (2). As described in our case report, we opted for a multi-agent regimen not only due to specific individual role of each drug in the treatment of PAPA syndrome but also because of the possible augmented effect of combined therapy. Initially, a short course of systemic corticosteroid (prednisone 30 mg/day for 3 weeks) was introduced in order to alleviate acute symptoms until other agents started showing their effects. The initial dose of administered corticosteroid was gradually tapered by 5 mg every week and soon discontinued. Adalimumab (40 mg every 2 weeks for 12 months) was chosen since its previous administration was without significant adverse effects and with more acceptable end results, unlike therapy with anakinra (8). In addition, TNF-alpha inhibitors, such as adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, have been generally regarded as a more effective treatment option for cutaneous changes, while anakinra, an anti-IL-1 agent, has been more beneficial in alleviating joint symptoms (9-11). Since the skin of our patient was significantly more affected than the joints, adalimumab was a preferred option for biological treatment. Finally, isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months) also found a place in our multi-agent therapy plan as a specific, supportive treatment agent for acne (12). Due to the fact that our national health insurance system covered the costs of treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors for only 12 months, adalimumab had to be discontinued after the end of this period. Episodes of acute exacerbation that the patient experienced after the cessation of multi-agent regimen were addressed with systemic corticosteroids and symptomatic therapy. Based on case reports, corticosteroids are usually one of the first agents to be administered in patients diagnosed with PAPA syndrome. They are frequently effective in alleviating joint symptoms, but, on the other hand, high doses of corticosteroids can worsen acne lesions (6). Moreover, due to the multiple side-effects of corticosteroids, such as electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, growth suppression, and adrenal insufficiency (13), a steroid-sparing agent is typically introduced into treatment together with or after corticosteroid therapy. A substantial step forward in the treatment of PAPA syndrome has been achieved with the introduction of medications targeting cytokines crucial in the pathogenesis of this disorder. The two most commonly used groups of such biological drugs have been those that block TNF-alpha and IL-1. A longer lasting improvement of symptoms has been achieved in a number of cases with both types of agents. Since other medications have often failed to establish long-term control of PAPA syndrome, such effects can be seen as a valuable accomplishment (6,14). Regardless of this observation, the response to treatment still differs between patients. More variable effects have been documented for IL-1 inhibitors, such as anakinra, while TNF-alpha inhibitors, such as adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, have been associated with more steady responses (4,6,10). The inconsistent effect of biologic therapies could be explained by the fact that PSTPIP1 protein is involved in various biochemical processes in different cells of the immune system. Thuse, none of the medications has an adequate spectrum of activity to control all involved immunological pathways (5,15). Overall, due to scarcity of valid information and guidelines, there is an increasing need for multicentric randomized controlled trials that would provide evidence-based data on effective treatment options for PAPA syndrome. Despite the rarity of this disorder, extensive research should be performed in order to discover therapies that could successfully manage all different manifestations of PAPA syndrome. Consequently, such efforts and breakthroughs would lead to decreased mortality and improved quality of life for patients suffering from this debilitating disease. The case described herein shows that PAPA syndrome can remain undiagnosed for longer periods of time, resulting in delayed treatment. Furthermore, the available therapeutic options are not sufficient to achieve long-term remission in many patients. Thus, continuous and comprehensive research is vital for ensuring adequate care of patients with PAPA syndrome.",2023 Nov,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on PAPA syndrome, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on PAPA syndrome, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses PAPA syndrome and its treatment, focusing on the clinical presentation, genetic basis, and therapeutic approaches, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses PAPA syndrome and its treatment, focusing on the clinical presentation, genetic basis, and therapeutic approaches, but it does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,95,,

It can lead to pseudomembranous colitis characterized by electrolyte disturbances, toxic megacolon, and septic shock. The risk of C. difficile infection is higher with use of certain classes of antibiotics, or when an antibiotic used for a long time. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic known to be safe, with few adverse effects such as diarrhea, stomach pain, and constipation. Azithromycin is currently used for the treatment of acne, with different dosing regimens for patients who cannot receive traditional treatment based on practice guidelines. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman was treated with a course of azithromycin 500 mg by mouth 3 times weekly for 6 weeks for acne vulgaris. This was her second antibiotic course of acne treatment within 10 months. A few days after completion of the second azithromycin course, she presented to the clinic with worsening abdominal pain and frequent soft bloody stool. A complete blood count test, C. difficile toxin test, stool culture, and colonoscopy were ordered. She was diagnosed with C. difficile infection confirmed by C. difficile toxin and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Despite the safety profile of azithromycin, our patient was predisposed to a non-severe case of C. difficile-associated diarrhea, most likely due to the repeated course of the azithromycin regimen that was used to treat her acne vulgaris.

37919943,,Hemorrhagic stroke caused by xylometazoline poisoning.,Banas BP||Brzezniakiewicz-Janus K||Majdanik S||Parafiniuk M||Luzny S||Stachowicz A||Janus T,"An increase in the use of over-the-counter medications has been observed in recent years. This also concerns xylometazoline, approved for the treatment of allergic rhinitis or upper respiratory tract infections. We present the fatal case of a 40 year-old-woman with a massive hemorrhagic stroke. Initial toxicology tests of biological material collected during autopsy revealed the presence of xylometazoline. No other significant toxicology findings were noted. LC-MS/MS method has been developed to determine xylometazoline concentration, which was 18.6 ng/mL in blood and 498.9 ng/mL in urine. The macroscopically detected hemorrhagic focus was confirmed by histopathological which confirmed hemorrhagic infarcts in the brain tissue, especially in the subarachnoid area. No other pathological changes were found. Based on findings from autopsy and toxicological analyses, the direct cause of death was concluded to be hemorrhagic stroke resulting from xylometazoline intoxication. Although xylometazoline products are regarded as relatively safe and are available over the counter, the risk of adverse effects, in particular stroke leading to death, should be considered.

It exhibits a significantly higher rate of malignant transformation compared to other OPMDs. The use of Intralesional Triamcinolone Acetonide Injection has emerged as a highly effective treatment option and has become the cornerstone of managing this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old female and a 40-year-old male presented with burning sensation and limited mouth opening, leading to diagnosis of OSMF. Both patients were treated with Triamcinolone Acetonide (TAC) Intralesional injections. Following a few months of treatment, a significant improvement in mouth opening was observed. However, both patients began experiencing symptoms such as facial rounding (mooning of the face), a buffalo hump, uneven hair growth, and swelling in the lower extremities. Upon recognizing these symptoms as indicative of Cushing's Syndrome, the administration of TAC injection was discontinued. Both patients were referred to a higher-level medical facility for confirmatory tests, which revealed elevated cortisol levels in both morning (Cortisol A.M) and evening (Cortisol P.M).

Untreated RBD carries risks for physical injury from falls or other traumatic events during dream enactment as well as risk of injury to the bed partner. Currently, melatonin and clonazepam are the mainstay pharmacological therapies for RBD. However, therapeutic response to these medications is variable. While older adults are most vulnerable to RBD, they are also particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of Alzheimer disease. Prazosin is a centrally active alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist often prescribed for trauma nightmares characterized by REM sleep without atonia in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. We report a case of successful RBD management with prazosin in a patient in whom high-dose melatonin was ineffective. Although there was no observable reduction in dream-enactment behaviors with high-dose melatonin, the possibility of a synergistic effect of prazosin combined with melatonin cannot be ruled out.

Patients with acute hyponatremia should be evaluated based on volume status and serum osmolality to determine potential causes and appropriate treatment. The aim of this case report is to illustrate the importance of using a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate medication formulation and the potential impact on a patient's clinical course. SUMMARY: A 34-year-old male was admitted for type A aortic dissection and was treated with an esmolol infusion and underwent operative repair. Two days after initiation of esmolol, the patient developed seizures and antiepileptics were initiated. The patient's serum sodium concentration was found to have decreased by a total of 14 mEq/L since admission. The patient had received more than 6 L of esmolol formulated in sterile water over the course of 2 days. The esmolol infusion was converted to another antihypertensive agent, and 0.9% sodium chloride injection was initiated, after which the serum sodium concentration began to recover. No further seizures were observed on continuous electroencephalography, and all antiepileptic drugs were discontinued with no seizure activity. CONCLUSION: The esmolol product utilized in this case was formulated in 250 mL of sterile water, which is suspected to have contributed to the patient's hyponatremia.

37767082,PMC10521070,Case Report: Buprenorphine-precipitated fentanyl withdrawal treated with high-dose buprenorphine.,Bormann NL||Gout A||Kijewski V||Lynch A,"Background: Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the mu-opioid receptor, is an increasingly prescribed medication for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder. When this medication is taken in the context of active opioid use, precipitated withdrawal can occur, leading to acute onset of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Fentanyl complicates use of buprenorphine, as it slowly releases from body stores and can lead to higher risk of precipitated withdrawal. Objectives: Describe the successful management of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal from fentanyl with high doses of buprenorphine. We seek to highlight how no adverse effects occurred in this patient and illustrate his stable transition to outpatient treatment. Case report: We present the case of a patient with severe opioid use disorder who presented in moderately severe opioid withdrawal after taking non-prescribed buprenorphine-naloxone which precipitated opioid withdrawal from daily fentanyl use. He was treated with high doses of buprenorphine, 148 mg over the first 48 hours, averaging 63 mg per day over four days. The patient reported rapid improvement in withdrawal symptoms without noted side effects and was able to successfully taper to 16 mg twice daily by discharge. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine at high doses for treatment of precipitated withdrawal. While other options include symptomatic withdrawal management, initiating methadone or less researched options like ketamine, utilizing buprenorphine can preserve or re-establish confidence in this life-saving medication.

Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, has become a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for stage II non-small cell lung cancer since 2019. Although much more common with nivolumab, several immune-related adverse effects, particularly endocrinopathies, have been linked with pembrolizumab. We describe a case of a 59-year-old man with a history of unspecified lung cancer who presented with severe hyponatremia later attributed to secondary adrenal insufficiency and accompanying primary hypothyroidism secondary to pembrolizumab. Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab can be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, making it crucial to rule out other causes of hyponatremia. Immunotherapy is known to cause thyroid immune-related adverse events, and anti-thyroid antibodies may not always be present in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Although there are some reported cases of pembrolizumab-induced adrenal insufficiency, the link between immunotherapy and endocrine disorders remains unclear. To our knowledge, no case reports exist that describe both primary hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency after taking pembrolizumab, although such cases have been documented with axitinib.

Second-line albuvirtide (ABT) with an optimized antiretroviral background therapy was approved for adults and adolescents after first-line treatment failure. This paper describes the treatment outcomes and adverse effects of an ABT-based dual-active antiretroviral treatment regimen in a child with MDR HIV strains. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13 year-old Chinese female patient infected with MDR HIV strains showed a decrease in viral load (from 4.48 log10 to 1.73 log10) and an increase in CD4 + T cells (from 15 to 308 cells/microl) after 12 months of treatment with an ABT-based antiretroviral regimen.

The characterization of novel mutations is advantageous for the clinical management of FV-deficient patients. METHODS: Coagulation screening and thrombin generation assay were performed with the plate-poor plasma. All 25 exons of the F5 gene were amplified and sequenced. The ClustalX-2.1 software was applied to the multiple sequence alignment. The possible adverse effects of mutations were investigated with online bioinformatics software and protein modeling. RESULTS: Two unrelated families with FV deficiency were under investigation. Proband A was an 18-year-old youth with recurrent epistaxis. Proband B was a 29-year-old woman who did not present with any bleeding symptoms. Three heterozygous mutations (p.Gln1532*, p.Phe218Ser, and p.Asp2222Gly) were detected. Interestingly, they were compound heterozygotes and both contained the p.Asp2222Gly, a polymorphism. The thrombin generation assay showed that both patients had impaired ability of thrombin generation, and in particular, proband A was more severe.

We report a case of Rhino cerebral mucormycosis infection in a 67-year-old patient after recovery from COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Rhino cerebral mucormycosis in a 67-year-old patient with preexisting health conditions after recovering from COVID-19 and to highlight the importance of early detection and treatment of co-infections in patients with pre-existing health conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient had pre-existing health conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which made him more vulnerable to complications after COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a dark discharge from his left eye, later confirmed to be due to mucormycosis. Histopathological examination revealed invasive mucormycosis, highlighting the importance of early detection and treatment. However, the patient experienced Acute kidney injury (AKI) after only 5 days of treatment with conventional amphotericin B, underscoring the need for careful monitoring and adjustment of treatment regimens. DISCUSSION: The case underscores the need for early detection and treatment of co-infections in vulnerable patients. The patient's pre-existing conditions and immunocompromised state made him more susceptible to the infection. The case also highlights the importance of careful monitoring and adjustment of treatment regimens to minimize the risk of adverse effects.

MMR status can be diagnosed by both immunohistochemistry (IHC) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Since tumors with MMR deficiency are prone to respond to immunotherapy immune checkpoint inhibitors are used to treat such tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male patient presented to an outside clinic with weight loss and abdominal pain. Radiological investigations detected a mesenteric mass of 10 cm, peritoneal implants, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The eventual biopsy result from the mesenteric mass was mucinous adenocarcinoma with a goblet cell pattern. Since the IHC result was unclear for deficiency in mismatch repair (dMMR) metastatic CRC (mCRC), the diagnosis was confirmed with PCR. The patient received 8 cycles of FOLFIRINOX + bevacizumab followed by FOLFOX combined with pembrolizumab. No adverse effect was reported related to immunotherapy which resulted in radiologic and metabolic regression. The patient underwent cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The final pathology results revealed a pathological complete response and R0 resection.

METHODS: Retrospective and descriptive case report. Eleven consecutive patients with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of CM treated with brachytherapy between 1992 and 2023 were reviewed. Demographic, clinical, and dosimetric characteristics as well as recurrences were recorded. Quantitative variables were represented by the mean, median, and standard deviation, and qualitative variables by frequency of distribution. RESULTS: Of a total of 27 patients diagnosed with CM, 11 who were treated with brachytherapy were included in the study (7 female; mean age at time of treatment: 59.4 years). Mean follow-up was 58.82 months (range 11-141 months). Of a total of 11 patients, 8 were treated with ruthenium-106 and 3 with iodine-125. Brachytherapy was performed in 6 patients as adjuvant therapy after biopsy-proven CM on histopathology and in the other 5 patients after recurrence. The mean dose was 85 Gy in all cases.

37224475,PMC10663378,MACULAR SLING: A CUSTOMIZABLE METHOD FOR MACULAR BUCKLING USING AVAILABLE ELEMENTS.,Clark A||Souverein EA||Rootman DB||Yang D||Kreiger AE||Nagiel A,"PURPOSE: Macular buckling surgery is used to treat certain cases of myopic traction maculopathy but is rarely performed in the United States. One of the main factors limiting its use is the lack of commercially available buckling elements. Here, we describe a novel technique for creating an effective macular buckle using readily obtainable buckling materials. METHODS: By using a traditional circumferential 41 band as the anchoring point around the globe, a 240 band can then be attached and oriented posteriorly along the superonasal-inferotemporal axis. This posterior 240 band is then used to guide a grooved sponge (509G) under the macula to create a customizable and titratable tamponade effect along the posterior pole. This approach was used to provide external support in the case of a recurrent, complex tractional retinal detachment which had failed multiple prior vitrectomy-based repairs. RESULTS: Placement of the macular sling resolved the patient's recurrent retinal detachment with return of the visual acuity to her preoperative baseline. There have been no adverse effects related to the surgery aside from a large hyperopic shift due to the buckle effect on the macula. We believe the technical and material complexity of this technique is comparable with that of more common scleral buckling techniques. CONCLUSION: This macular sling technique can be used to create an effective posterior buckle without requiring specialized materials.",2024 Sep 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a surgical technique for macular buckling and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses a surgical technique for macular buckling and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

There are many reports on intracranial infections caused by CR-Kp, but only a few on brain abscesses caused by CR-Kp. Here, we present a case of brain abscess caused by CR-Kp successfully treated with combined antibiotics. A 26-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital due to high fever and headache. His past medical history includes a surgical intervention due to an acute subdural hematoma, performed at an external healthcare center. After the current diagnosis of cerebral abscess, he underwent two surgeries. During the procedure, multiple cerebral abscesses were drained and capsulotomies were performed under ultrasound guidance. The combination of meropenem and vancomycin was started. The contents of the abscesses were sent to the microbiology and pathology laboratory. On the 3 rd day of treatment, the medical team was informed that CR-Kp grew in an abscess culture. The patient's treatment was changed to meropenem + colistin + tigecycline. The patient developed electrolyte disturbances during the follow-up and this was considered an adverse effect of colistin. On the 41 st day of treatment, colistin was discontinued, fosfomycin was added, and meropenem and tigecycline were maintained. Treatment was discontinued on the 68 th day, when the patient was discharged. The general condition of the patient, who has been followed up for two years, is satisfactory. The treatment of CR-Kp infections should be individualized, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics should be considered in each case.",2023,20230324.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of brain abscess caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}",The article discusses a case of brain abscess caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.,2,95,,
36978171,PMC10054042,Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury related to use of novel selective androgen receptor modulator RAD140 (Testalone): a case report.,Ladna M||Taylor K||Bhat A||Dideban B,"BACKGROUND: RAD140 (Testalone) is a novel selective androgen receptor modulator with very limited data currently available on adverse effects related to this compound. The first-in-human phase 1 trial was recently published and did report a significant proportion of elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and total bilirubin among the test subjects. RAD140 may be associated with an idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury. It is easily purchased online as a workout supplement. Given its ease of use from being an oral formulation, and not requiring a physician's prescription, its use among the young male population will likely rise. Clinicians should ask about the use of RAD140, and other workout supplements, in young men presenting with acute liver injury. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 26-year-old Caucasian male without any significant past medical history who presented with nausea, vomiting, severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and jaundice from acute liver injury. Extensive inpatient workup did not reveal a definite cause for his liver injury other than the use of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator called RAD140 (Testalone). He was treated with supportive care and discharged after short hospitalization. He was instructed to stop RAD140, which he reported compliance with, and on 2-month follow-up his liver function panel had normalized without recurrence of any symptoms. CONCLUSION: Novel selective androgen receptor modulators such as RAD140 may be associated with idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury. Workup of new liver injury in young and middle-aged males should involve asking about use of these novel compounds, for if missed and use continues, it can likely lead to fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.",2023 Mar 29,20230329.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury related to RAD140, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury related to RAD140, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,

Here is a case of vemurafenib-induced uveitis, peculiar in both its presentation and management. METHODS: Case report, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenge. RESULTS: Uveitis is a known side effect of vemurafenib. It is generally bilateral, moderate, manageable with topical steroids, and does not require cancer therapy cessation. We present a patient who suffered from a unilateral, severe uveitis after vemurafenib treatment that fully recovered thanks to intravitreal methotrexate injections because conventional corticosteroid therapy was contraindicated. CONCLUSION: Uveitis can be a serious ocular adverse effect of vemurafenib, whereas its risk factors and mechanisms remain unknown. As BRAF inhibitors are now used on a regular basis, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this potentially sight-threatening side effect.

ICI-associated renal adverse effects are rare and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is the most common in the renal irAE. However, only a few case reports of renal vasculitis associated with ICI have been reported. In addition, the characteristics of infiltrating inflammatory cells of ICI-associated TIN and renal vasculitis have been uncertain. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man received immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) and anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) antibodies for aggravated metastatic malignant melanoma. About 1 week after the second administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab, acute kidney injury developed. A renal biopsy was performed that showed TIN and non-necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis in interlobular arteries. Massive CD3(+) T cells and CD163(+) macrophages infiltrated both tubulointerstitium and interlobular arteries. Many infiltrating cells tested positive for Ki-67 and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), but negative for PD-1. In CD3(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells were predominantly infiltrated, and these cells were positive for Granzyme B (GrB) and cytotoxic granule TIA-1, but negative for CD25, indicating antigen-independent activated CD8(+) T cells. Infiltration of CD4(+) T cells was noted without obvious CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. His renal dysfunction recovered within 2 months of treatment with prednisolone in addition to discontinuation of nivolumab and ipilimumab. CONCLUSIONS: We herein reported a case of ICI-related TIN and renal granulomatous vasculitis with infiltration of massive antigen-independent activated CD8(+) T cells and CD163(+) macrophages, and none or few CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells. These infiltrating cells might be a characteristic of the development of renal irAE.",2023 Mar 9,20230309.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on immune checkpoint inhibitors and their association with renal adverse events.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on immune checkpoint inhibitors and their association with renal adverse events.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically focusing on renal complications, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically focusing on renal complications, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

More often, medical professionals are faced with privately acquired electrocardiogram data of undetermined quality recorded by smartwatches. This is boasted by results and suggestions for medical benefits, based on industry-sponsored trials and potentially biased case reports. Yet potential risks and adverse effects have been widely overlooked. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes an emergency consultation of a 27-year-old Swiss-German man lacking known previous medical conditions who developed an episode of anxiety and panic due to pain in the left chest prompted by over-interpretation of unremarkable electrocardiogram readings of his smartwatch. Fearing acute coronary syndrome, he presented at the emergency department. His smartwatch electrocardiograms, as well as a 12-lead electrocardiogram, appeared normal. After extensive calming and reassuring, as well as symptomatic therapy with paracetamol and lorazepam, the patient was discharged with no indications for further treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the potential risks of anxiety from nonprofessional electrocardiogram recordings by smartwatches.

Approximately 2 h after the injection, she developed lower abdominal pain. The patient was taken to the hospital approximately 5 h later due to worsening pain. When the patient was admitted for physical examination, she suddenly experienced cardiac and respiratory arrest. She was resuscitated but remained in a coma. Unfortunately, the patient died approximately 12 h after being admitted to the hospital. The forensic autopsy revealed extensive amorphous basophilic emboli in the small interstitial vascular lumen of both lungs, and a large amount of the same type of substances were also found in the vaginal wall. Hyaluronidase digestion and Alcian blue staining confirmed that most components of the injection were hyaluronic acid (HA). HA is widely used as a cosmetic filler in the field of plastic surgery and is generally considered to have few adverse effects.

36727661,,The experience of flow cytometry for specific antibody against cisplatin-treated red blood cells: A case report.,Suzuki K||Nagaharu K||Maruyama M||Matsumoto T||Ohishi K||Tawara I,"BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-associated hemolysis is a rare but important adverse effect. Nonimmunological protein adsorption (NIPA) due to erythrocyte membrane modification has been reported as the leading cause of cisplatin-associated hemolysis. However, limited data exist on cisplatin-associated immunological hemolysis because of a lack of an established diagnostic method. Here, we used flow cytometry (FCM) to diagnose a patient with cisplatin-associated immunological hemolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 55-year-old woman with uterocervical cancer was treated with weekly cisplatin monotherapy (40 mg/m(2) ). She had no previous transfusion and medication history, nor any significant family history. On the 26th day after cisplatin administration, severe hemolysis was noted. Her red blood cells (RBCs) and sera were evaluated by direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), respectively. To explore immunological reactions for cisplatin-treated RBCs, we attempted FCM using cisplatin-treated and -untreated RBCs. After incubating conditioned RBCs with the patient's serum or healthy donor serum, we evaluated their fluorescent intensity by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies. RESULTS: The patient's DAT was positive, and an IAT using her plasma was positive for cisplatin-treated RBCs. FCM using cisplatin-treated RBCs revealed that the patient's serum had higher FITC intensity than the donor's serum, indicating the existence of cisplatin-treated RBC-specific IgGs in patient's serum. CONCLUSION: Here, we report a rare case of a patient with hemolysis diagnosed using FCM to identify specific antibodies against cisplatin-treated RBCs.

M. fortuitum complex is a rapidly growing pathogenic species that is of clinical relevance to both humans and animals. This pathogen has the potential to create adverse effects on human healthcare. METHODS: The MF GZ001 clinical strain was collected from the sputum of a 45-year-old male patient with a pulmonary infection. The morphological studies, comparative genomic analysis, and drug resistance profiles along with variants detection were performed in this study. In addition, comparative analysis of virulence genes led us to understand the pathogenicity of this organism. RESULTS: Bacterial growth kinetics and morphology confirmed that MF GZ001 is a rapidly growing species with a rough morphotype. The MF GZ001 contains 6413573 bp genome size with 66.18 % high G+C content. MF GZ001 possesses a larger genome than other related mycobacteria and included 6156 protein-coding genes. Molecular phylogenetic tree, collinearity, and comparative genomic analysis suggested that MF GZ001 is a novel member of the M. fortuitum complex. We carried out the drug resistance profile analysis and found single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations in key drug resistance genes such as rpoB, katG, AAC(2')-Ib, gyrA, gyrB, embB, pncA, blaF, thyA, embC, embR, and iniA. In addition, the MF GZ001strain contains mutations in iniA, iniC, pncA, and ribD which conferred resistance to isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and para-aminosalicylic acid respectively, which are not frequently observed in rapidly growing mycobacteria. A wide variety of predicted putative potential virulence genes were found in MF GZ001, most of which are shared with well-recognized mycobacterial species with high pathogenic profiles such as M. tuberculosis and M. abscessus. DISCUSSION: Our identified novel features of a pathogenic member of the M. fortuitum complex will provide the foundation for further investigation of mycobacterial pathogenicity and effective treatment.",2022,20230104.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

Albeit rare, there have also been documented cases of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) associated with lithium use. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old woman with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, managed with lithium 300 mg by mouth every day for 3 years, was assessed for a 1-year history of polyuria with accompanying polydipsia. During her initial hospital stay, her estimated urine output was more than 4 L per day. Initial labs showed elevated serum sodium (149 mmol/L; reference range 135-145), elevated serum osmolality (304 mOsm/kg; reference range 275-295), urine osmolality of 99 mOsm/kg (reference range 50-1200), and urine specific gravity (1.005; reference range 1.005-1.030). Lithium was at a subtherapeutic level of 0.05 mEq/L (reference range 0.6-1.2). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no abnormalities of the pituitary gland. Two different occasions of desmopressin administration resulted in >50% increase in urine osmolality, confirming the diagnosis of CDI. Common causes of CDI, including trauma, tumors, and familial CDI, were ruled out and chronic lithium use was determined as the most probable cause for the patient's CDI. CONCLUSIONS CDI in the background of chronic lithium use is rarely reported. We present this case to consider CDI as a differential diagnosis when evaluating polyuria and hypernatremia in patients with long-term lithium use.

Definitive stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is suggested for those who are unfit for or refuse surgical intervention. Here we present a patient with 2 lung cancer lesions who received SABR simultaneously with magnetic resonance Linear accelerator (Linac)-magnetic resonance (MR). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 46-years-old man had history of left lower lung cancer post lobectomy in 2018. Two recurrent tumors were found 2 years following, then became enlarged 4 months later. DIAGNOSES: The recurrent tumors were found by computed tomography. INTERVENTIONS: SABR was indicated due to inoperability and small size. Simulation was done both by computed tomography and MR scan with ViewRay MRIdian Linac, with the prescription dose being 50 gray in 4 fractions performed every other day within 2 weeks. The 2 lesions were irradiated at the same time with a single isocenter with mean treatment time was 78 minutes. OUTCOMES: No acute side effect was noted. Follow-up chest computed tomography scan 14 months after SABR showed mild consolidation and pneumonitis over the upper irradiated site favoring radiation-related reasons, while pneumonitis was resolved over the lower irradiated site. Positron emission tomography showed no definite evidence of FDG-avid recurrence. The patient has survived over 18 months following SABR and more than 4 years from the first diagnosis of lung cancer without significant adverse effects.

One of the possible immune-related adverse effects of ICI is pneumonitis, which is a life-threatening condition that can present as a variety of radiographic patterns, so it can be difficult to differentiate from infectious cases of pneumonia based on radiological findings alone. We present a rare case of miliary tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in a patient receiving programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor therapy mimicking autoimmune pneumonitis and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this unexpected event. We presented a 52-year-old patient with stage IV non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) who was admitted to the hospital with radiological and clinical signs of pneumonitis caused by immunotherapy-Pembrolizumab. During hospitalization, she was clinically, laboratory, and microbiologically processed and her diagnosis of M. tuberculosis was confirmed. Initial treatment started with corticosteroids as a pneumonitis treatment, and because there was no adequate response, and the diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed, treatment with a four-regimen antituberculotic drug started. On a control, CT scan regression in distribution and number of changes in lungs occurred. After a while, patient died due to hepatic failure. There are not many reported cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients receiving immunotherapy; to our knowledge, no cases of M. tuberculosis in a patient with lung cancer were described. Since there is a different approach to the treatment of tuberculosis and pneumonitis, we presented our dilemmas and literature review in this article.

An uncommon adverse effect of GBP is urinary incontinence (UI). We report the case of a 61-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who developed probable overflow UI while receiving 1200 mg/day of GBP for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The patient self-tapered GBP to 600 mg/day which resolved the overflow UI, but resulted in poorly controlled bilateral foot pain. The palliative care physician rotated the patient to pregabalin 150 mg/day and his bilateral foot pain improved after his regimen was titrated to 200 mg/day. The patient did not experience overflow UI while taking pregabalin despite the similar pharmacology and comparable doses to GBP. We believe this is the first case report to describe subsequent achievement of pain control by substituting pregabalin without recurrence of UI.

This gene encodes for the VHL protein, which regulates the activity of HIF-alpha, a transcription factor involved in the cellular response to hypoxia. Mutations in VHL lead to the accumulation of HIF-alpha and, consequently, the engagement of hypoxia-sensitive genes with tumorigenic effects. VHL disease is associated with the development of tumors in multiple organs, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). Belzutifan is an HIF-alpha inhibitor; however, it has not been previously evaluated in patients with metastatic or treatment-refractory pNETs. This report presents a 43-year-old woman with VHL-associated metastatic pNET treated with belzutifan after progression on multiple systemic therapies. She began treatment with belzutifan and experienced partial radiographic response within 1 month of treatment. Other than asymptomatic anemia, no adverse effects developed during 5 months of ongoing therapy.

There is no known antidote to olanzapine intoxication. Overdosing olanzapine can cause, tremor, bradykinesia, hypotension somnolence, coma, and miosis. CASE REPORT We present the case of a previously healthy 69-year-old man who after routine mitral valve surgery developed pneumonia and severe sepsis requiring several weeks on a ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit. He developed delirium and paranoia and was prescribed olanzapine. After 4 doses, he became hypotensive and nonresponsive and developed pinpoint pupils. The symptoms were reversed minutes after administration of flumazenil. The clinical picture in this case corresponds well with an olanzapine intoxication. No other drugs, such as benzodiazepines or opioids, had been administered that could explain the reaction. Olanzapine intoxication is known to present with hypotension, coma, and miosis. The doses given were normal starting doses for olanzapine in the outpatient setting but much higher than recommended doses in the intensive care setting. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates a risk for severe adverse effects, even within normal prescription range, when olanzapine is used in the intensive care setting. Finally, it is intriguing that the symptoms were reversed after administration of flumazenil, a selective competitive antagonist of the GABA receptor. Olanzapine mainly effects dopamine, serotonin, a1-adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic receptors, but a low affinity to GABA and benzodiazepine sites can perhaps explain the observed effect.",2022 Dec 1,20221201.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of olanzapine intoxication, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of olanzapine intoxication, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

However, it is necessary to validate the functional attributes of A. melegueta seed extract in human subjects. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial design, we have examined the thermogenic effects of a standardized A. melegueta seed extract (AfperFit). A total of 70 overweight male and female subjects (BMI >/=25.0 to </=30.0 kg/m(2)) aged 20-50 years were enrolled and administered with either 250 mg of AfperFit or placebo in capsule form twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints included energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)) and fat distribution (computed tomography (CT scan)), analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The effect of intervention on the quality of life was examined using SF-12 questionnaire. RESULTS: Consumption of AfperFit significantly increased the energy expenditure (p<0.01), visceral fat area (p<0.001) and visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio (p<0.01) compared to placebo group. Consequently, there was significant body weight loss and reduction in BMI of subjects in AfperFit group compared to placebo (p<0.01). The safety evaluation showed that biochemical and hematological parameters were in the normal range. Supplementation of AfperFit was well tolerated during the study and no adverse effects were observed.

Severe hypoxia with hypoxic vasoconstriction caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can induce pulmonary hypertension with hemodynamic implications, mainly secondary to right ventricle (RV) systolic function impairment. We report the case of the use of iNO in a critically ill patient with bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and severe ARDS and hypoxemia leading to acute severe PAH, causing a ventilation/perfusion mismatch, RV pressure overload, and RV systolic dysfunction. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old woman was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with a severe ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Severe hypoxia and hypoxic vasoconstriction developed, leading to an acute increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, severe to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, RV pressure overload, RV systolic function impairment, and RV dilatation. Following 24 h of treatment with iNO at 15 ppm, significant oxygenation and hemodynamic improvement were noted, allowing vasopressors to be stopped. After 24 h of iNO treatment, echocardiography showed very mild tricuspid regurgitation, a non-dilated RV, no impairment of transverse free wall contractility, and no paradoxical septal motion. iNO was maintained for 7 days. The dose of iNO was progressively decreased with no adverse effects and maintaining an improvement of oxygenation and hemodynamic status, allowing respiratory weaning.

In addition to its application for treating malignancies, MTX is also used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. Adverse effects have been reported even at low doses (up to 25 mg/week), and there is risk of toxicity in the form of myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, or pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we report a case of a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, mucositis, and mucocutaneous ulcers and erosions. The patient was taking methotrexate 10 mg weekly without folic acid supplementation and was found to be pancytopenic. Despite treatment, the patient developed multiorgan failure and passed away after 16 days of hospitalization. Myelosuppression is considered the most serious side effect with the highest risk of mortality. Risk factors for toxicity include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, drug interactions, and medication errors. Importantly, serum levels of MTX do not correlate with toxicity; therefore, folinic acid rescue therapy should be started as soon as MTX toxicity is suspected.

Pediatric patients (age <20 years) undergoing allogeneic HCT and receiving letermovir prophylaxis in the Mayo Clinic Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective chart review. Medical records were reviewed to evaluate letermovir dosing, CMV levels, laboratory values, and reports of adverse effects. Between October 2020 and April 2022, 9 patients age 4 to 19 years undergoing allogeneic HCT in the Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program received letermovir prophylaxis, either 240 mg or 480 mg daily at a mean and median dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Letermovir was crushed and administered via nasogastric tube in 4 of 9 patients. Two patients received letermovir for secondary CMV prophylaxis after initial treatment with ganciclovir/valganciclovir, and the remaining 7 received letermovir for primary prophylaxis. One patient, a 20-kg 6-year-old female receiving 240 mg (12 mg/kg), experienced low-level CMV viremia while on letermovir. No other patients experienced CMV reactivation while on letermovir prophylaxis. In 2 patients, transient mild transaminitis was noted within the first weeks of letermovir therapy, which resolved without intervention, and its relationship to letermovir could not be clearly established.

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in a few patients. However, there is currently no research showing a direct relationship between the vaccine and acute pancreatitis. Here, we report a case of acute pancreatitis following Pfizer vaccination in a young healthy pregnant woman without any known risk factors. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of possible vaccine-induced pancreatitis in a pregnant woman. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 24-year-old South-Asian female, at 31 weeks of gestation, presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and worsening on lying supine, associated with nausea and vomiting. She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis with a serum lipase level of 4376 U/L and an ultrasound showing features of pancreatitis. The patient received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine 1 week prior to these symptoms. Detailed evaluation did not show any etiological cause of pancreatitis. The patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery and the baby was shifted to the neonatal intensive care unit in a stable condition. A computed tomography scan postpartum (day 2) demonstrated acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. The patient was managed conservatively in the intensive care unit and discharged home in a stable condition.

Recently, some reports have suggested that intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy is effective for this disease. To date, it remains unknown whether subcutaneous TCZ monotherapy is also effective. Here, we present a first case of GCA successfully treated with subcutaneous TCZ monotherapy. A 75-year-old woman presented with shoulder and hip pain. She was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and treated with low-dose prednisolone (15 mg daily); however, she discontinued glucocorticoid therapy at her discretion due to the psychiatric adverse effect (cognitive dysfunction). Seven months later, her shoulder and hip pain relapsed. Furthermore, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) revealed uptake in the descending thoracic aorta, indicating a complication of LVV. She refused to take glucocorticoid for fear of psychiatric adverse effects and chose subcutaneous TCZ monotherapy (162 mg weekly) for treating this life-threatening urgent condition. Nine months later, her shoulder and hip pain resolved and FDG-PET/CT demonstrated no uptake in the descending thoracic aorta, indicating a successful treatment with subcutaneous TCZ monotherapy for the disease. No adverse events and disease relapse were found during observation period.

Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery could reduce locoregional and distant recurrence and improve the survival rate for surgically resectable NSCLC. However, the value of neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced potentially resectable NSCLC remains controversial. Herein, we report a locally advanced potentially resectable NSCLC case with a history of breast cancer who achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) after preoperative treatment with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. A 50-year-old woman developed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (left lower lobe of the lung, stage IIIA-N2) after two years of chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy following a diagnosis of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Surgical resection was attempted despite an MDT classification as unamenable to curative surgical resection. After two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, the tumor significantly shrank, then the patient underwent a left lower lobectomy. Complete resection with negative margins (R0 resection) was achieved in the patient. The patient experienced grade 1-2 adverse effects and no grade 3 or worse adverse effects occurred. Cardiotoxicity did not occur in the patient despite prior anti-HER2 treatment for breast cancer.

Low molecular weight heparin is the mainstay of treatment. The use of direct oral anticoagulants is supported by established evidence for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis also in active cancer and they are prioritized over low molecular weight heparin for cancer-associated thrombosis according to current guidelines. However, upper limb deep vein thrombosis is poorly studied with scant data on the use of direct oral anticoagulants in noncatheter-related deep vein thrombosis. We report the case of a patient with noncatheter-related deep vein thrombosis and a rare tumor site effectively and safely treated with a direct oral anticoagulant, edoxaban, after lack of efficacy with low molecular weight heparin. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 35-year-old man with primitive mediastinal seminoma presented at our Cardio-Oncology Unit for prechemotherapy assessment. DIAGNOSIS: Persistent brachiocephalic deep vein thrombosis, despite full-dose enoxaparin, was detected at ultrasonography. INTERVENTION: We decided to switch the anticoagulant treatment from enoxaparin to edoxaban. OUTCOME: The 3-month ultrasonography showed almost total regression of the deep vein thrombosis without any adverse effects and a good patient compliance. LESSONS: We conducted a literature review on upper limb deep vein thrombosis, since its management is challenging due to inconsistency of evidence.

The incidence of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) has increased after the rapidly expanding indications and clinical applications of ICIs. We present a case of nivolumab and ipilimumab-induced encephalitis with rapidly worsening consciousness and full recovery following ICIs suspension and high-dose steroid coupled with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with stage 4 BRAF wild malignant melanoma with metastasis to the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes. Beyond progression with dacarbazine, ipilimumab and nivolumab combination were administered at the second-line treatment of metastatic setting. A week after the first cycle patient was reported to have a fever of more than 38 degrees C. Subacute cognitive impairment including mild changes in behavior was reported on the third day of fever. She suddenly developed confusion, dysarthria, and motor dysfunction a few days later. Due to the altered mental status accompanied by fever, lumbar puncture was performed with a pre-diagnosis of encephalitis, meningitis, and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: After excluding viral and autoimmune encephalitis, high-dose methylprednisolone was administered in addition to IVIG for 5 days with the diagnosis of immunotherapy-related encephalitis according to the recommendations for the management of irAEs.

Quite a few of them combine with tumor recurrence. Treatment planning for these patients is extremely difficult for oncologists, and effective treatments are lacking. CASE: A 42-year-old man had a history of recurrent NPC that was treated with 2 cycles of chemoradiotherapies from 2017 to 2019. Five months after the second round of chemoradiotherapy, an episode of massive nasal bleeding occurred. As positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed tumor recurrence in the left wall of nasopharynx, superselective embolization and subsequent intra-arterial infusion (IA, 4 times of cisplatin 60 mg + fluorouracil 1.0 g) were performed to stop bleeding and achieve tumor control. To date, the disease-free survival time has been over 1 year. No tumor recurrence or rebleeding is found except for alopecia on the left side.

Endocrinological adverse effects following the new mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 have been reported in several cases. Specific to the involvement of pituitary function; however, only a single case with hypophysis has been reported. This is the first case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency (IAD) following mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 31-year-old man received the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The first injection was uneventful. One day after the second injection, he noticed general fatigue and fever. In the following several days, he additionally developed headaches, nausea, and diarrhea. Four days after the vaccine injection, he visited a hospital with worsening of these symptoms. Physical examination revealed slight disorientation but no other deficits. Laboratory tests revealed hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and extremely low plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels (ACTH < 1.5 pg/ml, cortisol 1.6 mug/dl). He was diagnosed with adrenal crisis and was emergently treated with hydrocortisone. The symptoms responded well and he recovered within a few days. Magnetic resonance images after the replacement with hydrocortisone revealed an atrophic pituitary gland. The patient was referred to our tertiary hospital for further endocrinological examination. Pituitary endocrine load tests revealed isolated adrenocortical response deficiency. After other clinical assessments, he was diagnosed as having isolated ACTH deficiency. After initiation of hydrocortisone replacement, there has been no recurrence of symptoms related to adrenocortical insufficiency nor involvement of other pituitary functions. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of IAD potentially associated with COVID-19 immunization. Recent reports have emphasized the importance of adjuvants in the mRNA vaccine that induce the endocrinological adverse effects through disturbance of the autoimmune system, but details are still unclear.

35579488,,Antipsychotic-Induced Hypothermia After Starting Aripiprazole for Posttraumatic Agitation Management: A Case Report.,Diaz-Segarra N||Edmond A||Yonclas P,"OBJECTIVES: Antipsychotic-induced hypothermia is an uncommon type of secondary hypothermia resulting from neurotransmitter derangements within the nervous system thermoregulation pathway. The most common causative medications include olanzapine, haloperidol, and risperidone, with one published report of aripiprazole. Most individuals who develop antipsychotic-induced hypothermia receive neuroleptic treatment for psychiatric disorder management, with significantly fewer occurrences in those with neurologic disorders. There are currently no reports of antipsychotic-induced hypothermia after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), where antipsychotics are used for the off-label management of posttraumatic agitation. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of the patient's medical record was performed. RESULTS: We present a case of a 56-year-old man with a moderate TBI who developed recurrent episodes of antipsychotic-induced hypothermia after starting aripiprazole for posttraumatic agitation management. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first publication detailing antipsychotic-induced hypothermia occurring in a TBI patient.

35568569,,Effect of imatinib on oral wound healing after extraction: A rare case report.,Myers AL||Kiat-Amnuay S||Wang BY,"BACKGROUND: Proper tissue repair and healing after oral surgery are vital to achieve optimal outcomes. Certain medications may interfere with wound healing, but this debilitating adverse drug reaction is often not reported in the literature. It is unknown whether imatinib (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals) interferes with gingival healing after oral surgery. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old man with a dislodged crown and core buildup of tooth no. 19 sought treatment at a prosthodontic clinic. After examination, the patient consented to extraction, ridge preservation, and future implant placement. He had previous surgical resection of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor and was taking 400 mg of imatinib daily. After extraction and ridge preservation, delayed soft-tissue healing and loss of the coronal portion of bone graft were observed at 8 weeks after surgery. Delayed wound healing was observed again after revision surgery. After imatinib therapy was paused, the adverse effect subsided and the wound healed properly. On the basis of causality assessment and clinical judgment, the authors determined that imatinib was the probable cause of this adverse drug reaction. To their best knowledge, this is the first report of delayed gingival healing after oral surgery secondary to imatinib. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dental practitioners should consider the possibility of impaired healing among their patients taking imatinib, especially before procedures that damage gingival tissue, although this adverse drug reaction is not reported in the drug's package insert. Consult with the patient's oncologist is advised before dental manipulations; temporary discontinuation (or dose reductions) of imatinib may be warranted until wounded tissue heals properly.",2022 Aug,20220512.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effects of imatinib on oral wound healing, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the effects of imatinib on oral wound healing, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Traditionally, venous access is obtained by accessing the femoral vein or through direct internal jugular puncture. Although complication rates are low, life-threatening severe complications have been reported. Moreover, venous access can be challenging in large body habitus patients through these traditional routes. There is a growing trend of utilizing radial artery access for neuroendovascular procedures. Nevertheless, the use of upper limb veins in neurointerventional procedures is rare. We present 3 cases of the concurrent arterial and venous approach through the radial artery and cephalic or basilic vein of the forearm for diagnostic cerebral arteriography and venography. Radial access was obtained by using the standard technique, and venous access was obtained by cannulating cephalic or basilic vein using ultrasound guidance, and a 5F or 6F short sheath was placed. Venous angiography and catheterization of right and left internal jugular veins were then performed using a Simmons (SIM) 2 catheter alone or using 6F Envoy guide catheter coaxially over the SIM 2 catheter if an additional support for microcatheter was needed.

33770821,,Effect of gliding cupping with Roghan-e-Surkh in low back ache (Waja-uz-Zahr): a case series study.,Ahmad I||Nayab M||Ahmad T,"OBJECTIVES: Pain in joints is a major clinical problem since ancient times. Waja-uz-Zahr stands for low back pain which may arise from internal or external structures of lumbosacral region due to Su-e-Mizaj sada or maddi due to the surplus of Burudat or accumulation of Kham Balgham in lower back. Imala (diversion) and Taqiya-e-Mavad (Evacuation) are inevitable in case of maddi amraz. Hijama (cupping therapy) is a simple, safe, tolerable, and effective regimenal modality, helpful in the treatment of aches and pains. Gruner mentioned a special kind of cupping method in the canon of medicine of Avicenna where cupping glasses are glided over a specified area of body intending the diversion of morbid material under the name of Bier's treatment. The purpose of present case series was to provide the insight into the effect of gliding cupping in low back ache. CASE PRESENTATION: Three patients of Waja-uz-Zahr, aged between 29 and 64 years, were given gliding cupping treatment after the application of Roghan-e-Surkh on lumbosacral region alternatively for 14 days.

Anti-IL-6 treatments show a clear benefit with a significant steroid-sparing effect, but late relapses occur after treatment discontinuation. In addition to IL-6, IL-1 also appears to play a significant role in GCA pathophysiology. We report herein the efficacy of anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, in six GCA patients exhibiting corticosteroid dependence or resistance, specifically analysing the outcome of aortitis in four of them. METHODS: This retrospective study analysed the cases of all GCA patients treated with anakinra from the French Study Group for Large Vessel Vasculitis. RESULTS: After a median duration of anakinra therapy of 19 (18-32) months, all six patients exhibited complete clinical and biological remission. Among the four patients with large-vessel involvement, one had a disappearance of aortitis under anakinra and three showed a decrease in vascular uptake. After a median follow-up of 56 (48-63) months, corticosteroids were discontinued in four patients, and corticosteroid dosage could be decreased to 5 mg/day in two patients. One patient relapsed 13 months after anakinra introduction in the context of increasing the daily anakinra injection interval to every 48 h. Three patients experienced transient injection-site reactions, and one patient had pneumonia.

While the surgical intervention is a rule of thumb when treating and diagnosing the etiology of these lesions, this is not always possible due to dangerous or inaccessible locations. We report the case of a patient solely treated with empiric antibiotics without stereotaxic intervention and satisfactory results. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 21-year-old patient with a right thalamic abscess due to HHT and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, previously embolized, treated solely with antibiotics. At first, we contemplated the possibility of a stereotaxic biopsy, but the high-risk location and the fact that our patient received a previous full course of antibiotic treatment (in another center), made us discard this intervention because of the low diagnostic yield. We started an empiric antibiotic regime. We followed up very closely the clinical and radiological evaluation the next weeks, adjusting our antibiotic treatment when necessary. The results were favorable from both the radiological and clinical aspects and 6 months after the diagnosis the images show its almost complete disappearance.

However, lesions of tuberculosis directly invade the vertebrae and surrounding soft tissues, which increases the risk of esophageal perforation induced by the posterior pedicle screw placement. Herein, we report the first case of esophageal perforation following pedicle screw placement in the upper thoracic spinal tuberculosis, and describe the underlying causes, as well as the treatment and prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old female patient with upper thoracic spinal tuberculosis presented sputum-like secretions from the wound after she was treated with one-stage operation through the posterolateral approach. Endoscopy was immediately conducted, which confirmed that the patient complicated with postoperative esophageal perforation caused by screws. CT scan showed that the right screw perforated the anterior cortex of the vertebrae and the esophagus at the T4 level. Fortunately, mediastinal infection was not observed. The T4 screw was removed, Vacuum Sealing Drainage (VSD) was performed, and jejunum catheterization was used for enteral nutrition. After continuous treatment with sensitive antibiotics for 2.5 months and 5 times of VSD aspiration, the infected wound recovered gradually. With 18-month follow-up, the esophagus healed well, without symptoms of dysphagia and stomach discomfort, and CT scan showed that T2-4 had complete osseous fusion without sequestrum. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis increases the risk of postoperative esophageal perforation in a certain degree for patients with upper thoracic tuberculosis. The damages to esophagus during the operation should be prevented. The screws with the length no more than 30 mm should be selected. Moreover, close monitoring after operation should be conducted to help the early identification, diagnosis and treatment, which could help preventing the adverse effects induced by the delayed diagnosis and treatment of esophageal perforation.",2020 Nov 18,20201118.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on esophageal perforation following spinal surgery for tuberculosis, not on complications of COVID-19 vaccination.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on esophageal perforation following spinal surgery for tuberculosis, not on complications of COVID-19 vaccination.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of esophageal perforation following a surgical procedure for spinal tuberculosis, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of esophageal perforation following a surgical procedure for spinal tuberculosis, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

Although complications are unusual, obstructive symptoms produced by the stony-hard goiter may put patients' lives at risk. The diagnosis must be biopsy-proven, and treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement and anti-inflammatory drugs, although sometimes thyroidectomy may be required. CASE REPORT A 69-year-old woman presented with a 7-month history of progressive hypothyroidism and obstructive dysphagia. On physical examination, she had a large, stony-hard goiter. A Doppler ultrasound study revealed a massive, avascular enlargement of the thyroid gland. A computed tomography scan failed to demonstrate any extrathyroidal extension of the abnormal tissue. A Tru-Cut biopsy of the thyroid was performed. Extensive replacement of thyroid follicles by prominent bands of fibrous tissue was observed, with follicular obliteration and mild focal occlusive phlebitis. A lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was clearly identified; no oxyphilic nor giant cells were found. On immunohistochemistry, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4/IgG ratio in the plasma cell infiltrate was 40%; increased serum IgG4 levels were also found, supporting the diagnosis of Riedel's thyroiditis. The patient was successfully treated with levothyroxine replacement and tamoxifen with prompt resolution of obstructive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Fibrous thyroiditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism in a patient with a stony-hard goiter. Although steroids are often used as a therapeutic strategy for this disease, our patient had an excellent therapeutic response to tamoxifen, avoiding adverse effects associated with steroid therapy, the higher cost of monoclonal antibody therapy, and surgery-associated risks.",2020 Nov 12,20201112.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': ""The article focuses on Riedel's thyroiditis and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications."", 'score': 2}",The article focuses on Riedel's thyroiditis and does not discuss COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications.,2,100,"{'reasoning': ""The article discusses Riedel's thyroiditis and its treatment, with no mention of COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications, thus it does not meet the criteria."", 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses Riedel's thyroiditis and its treatment, with no mention of COVID-19 vaccinations or their complications, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

The purpose of this case report is to describe the first case of rhabdomyolysis as a severe and potentially life-threatening illness following use of a percussion gun. METHODS: A young Chinese woman with untreated iron deficiency anemia presented with fatigue and pain in her thigh muscles for 3 days and tea-colored urine for 1 day, after cycling and subsequently receiving percussion gun treatment by her coach for the purpose of massage and relaxing tired muscles. Muscle tenderness and multiple hematomas were found on her thighs, and her urinalysis indicated hemoglobinuria. Her serum creatine kinase was reported as ""undetectably high,"" a hallmark of serious muscle damage leading to a diagnosis of severe rhabdomyolysis. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, urine alkalinization via intravenous alkaline solution, assessment of urine output, and maintenance of electrolyte balance were administered during hospitalization. RESULTS: The patient's clinical presentation gradually improved with the decline of creatine kinase, and she recovered well during follow-up.

However, suvorexant has never been reported to cause SIADH. A 77-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was admitted to the Jichi Medical University Hospital for the treatment of major depression. During the treatment, he was prescribed suvorexant for insomnia. Twelve days after the initiation of suvorexant, he developed hyponatremia, which met the diagnostic criteria of SIADH. We suspected the hyponatremia to be an adverse drug effect of suvorexant because no other cause for SIADH was detected. Accordingly, suvorexant was discontinued 15 days after the onset of SIADH, and hyponatremia improved in 6 days.

CASE PRESENTATION: This report presents the diagnosis and treatment of a 65-year-old Chinese man who presented with cough and lymph node swellings in the left axillary region. The patient was diagnosed with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. He underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, prednisone) followed by TOMO radiotherapy (helical tomotherapy, a kind of radiotherapy for cancer treatment using spiral computed tomographic scanning). After treatment, the therapeutic effects were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography about every 3 months.

The oral form of emedastine is used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). However, data characterizing emedastine transfer across the placenta and excretion into breast milk are limited. In this case report, we assessed emedastine concentrations in maternal and neonatal blood, cord blood, and breast milk. Materials and Methods: After the patient provided informed consent, emedastine concentrations in maternal serum, breast milk, cord blood, and neonatal serum were measured while the mother was taking oral emedastine 2 mg once daily. Case Report: A 39-year-old woman with AR received emedastine during pregnancy and lactation. Her female infant was born at 37 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 2,820 g. Emedastine concentrations in maternal serum at 11.5 and 19.0 hours after maternal dosing were 0.39 and 0.22 ng/mL, respectively. The emedastine concentration in cord blood (19.6 hours after maternal dosing) was 0.18 ng/mL. At 24 hours after delivery (44 hours after maternal dosing), emedastine was under the lower limit of quantification (<0.05 ng/mL) in the infant's serum. Emedastine concentrations in breast milk ranged from 0.06 to 0.44 ng/mL. Calculated infant doses through breast milk were much lower than the clinical dose of emedastine. The infant had normal developmental progress and no detectable drug-related adverse effects. Conclusions: Rates of emedastine transfer into placenta and breast milk were low.

Common adverse effects from gabapentin include somnolence, sedation, and dizziness. Hyperglycemia is listed as a possible adverse drug reaction in the labeling. Case reports describe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, peritoneal dialysis, and/or incomplete medication records. The following case report details a hypoglycemia episode as a potential result of a gabapentin use in a patient without diabetes. SUMMARY: A 47-year old, 68 kg, white female presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. Her blood glucose level was 33 mg/dL. Gabapentin was started 1 week prior to the hypoglycemia episode. Her past medical history, concomitant medications, and other laboratory findings were not likely causes of her severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin appears to have effects on several voltage-gated calcium channels.

Triplixam is used to treat systemic hypertension and contains amlodipine, indapamide and perindopril arginine as active ingredients which might have induced the sudden myopia. The transient myopia with objective findings disappeared after the discontinuation of the drug. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a history of blurred vision in both eyes. Development of myopia, lens thickening, choroidal effusion and retinal striae at the macula with the increase in macular thickness was observed in both eyes. These symptoms cleared completely after the drug was discontinued. Myopisation could have been caused by lens thickening and changing its refractive index as a result of allergic or idiosyncratic reaction of the ciliary body. Retinal striae may be caused by the volume effect of the choroidal effusion. CONCLUSION: Our report describes the adverse effect of Triplixam, probably resulting from its ingredient indapamide.

Different strategies for therapeutic management are available; these include open surgical techniques or endovascular treatments. The choice of the treatment depends on the patient's clinical conditions and on the timing of the thrombosis. Bypass still remains the first choice in case of chronic occlusion but in the last 10 years, the use of percutaneous mechanical/rheolytic thrombectomy systems is increasing. These devices can be used in case of acute or subacute onset of native arterial and venous thrombosis or embolism and in case of graft occlusion. AngioJet is a percutaneous rheolytic mechanical thrombectomy system. Through a pressurized saline solution jet, a low-pressure zone is made up and the thrombus is fragmented and aspirated by the device. Different transient adverse effects caused by lysis of the thrombus are described such as hemoglobinuria but in some cases the release of high doses of the thrombus degradation products such as heme and adenosine diphosphate can lead to fatal consequences for the patient.

A polycythemia vera was ruled out.Management & outcome: The patient started a prophylactic therapy with lysine acetylsalicylate, and we observed a reduction of Hb, but not Hct. Due to disease progression, we interrupted Pazopanib. After a week from drug discontinuation, Hb levels got back to the normal range, Hct was lowering. We decided not to perform phlebotomy, considering the declining trend in Hb and Hct values and the absence of symptoms. DISCUSSION: We postulated a Pazopanib-related secondary erythrocytosis, since Hb and Hct levels increased from baseline during treatment, then normalized when Pazopanib was discontinued. We used the Naranjo Nomogram to assess the correlation between the adverse effect and Pazopanib, the correlation was ""Probable"", a score of 5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of Pazopanib-related secondary polycythemia in a patient with sarcoma.

32825876,,Irreversible neuropathy in extremely-drug resistant tuberculosis: An unfortunate clinical conundrum.,Saroha D||Garg D||Singh AK||Dhamija RK,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis is an increasing healthcare challenge. Drug regimen building demands the use of different therapeutic groups, many of which harbor neurotoxicity as a side-effect, whether central or peripheral. Peripheral neuropathy is a major concern as it tends to be severe and usually irreversible. Anti-tubercular drugs that may contribute to peripheral neuropathy include INH, ethambutol, linezolid, cycloserine and para-amino salicylic acid. This potential adverse effect must be balanced against the intrinsically grave prognosis that drug resistant tuberculosis harbors. We present such a clinically challenging case of a 25 years-old female with extremely drug resistant tuberculosis whose treatment necessitated the use of several neurotoxic anti-tubercular drugs, leading to severe sensory peripheral neuropathy who did not improve despite the withdrawal of culprit drugs. She developed positive and negative sensory symptoms in both lower limbs. Nerve conduction studies were suggestive of sensory neuropathy affecting both lower limbs. Alternate causes of peripheral neuropathy including HIV, vasculitis, B12 deficiency and diabetes were ruled out. Despite drug withdrawal, the patient did not improve significantly. This case emphasizes the irreversibility of anti-tubercular therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, demanding more rigorous clinical screening for the same while managing such patients.",2020 Jul,20191122.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the adverse effects of anti-tubercular drugs, not COVID-19 vaccines.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on the adverse effects of anti-tubercular drugs, not COVID-19 vaccines.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to drug-resistant tuberculosis and its treatment, specifically focusing on peripheral neuropathy caused by anti-tubercular drugs, which does not relate to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses complications related to drug-resistant tuberculosis and its treatment, specifically focusing on peripheral neuropathy caused by anti-tubercular drugs, which does not relate to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

We present 1 critically ill patient who had a rapid therapeutic response to moderate-dose corticosteroids. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old critically ill woman from Wuhan suffered with COVID-19. DIAGNOSIS: The chest computed tomography scan was suggestive of COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. The critically ill status was characterized by worsening dyspnea, progressing bilateral lung consolidation, and poor oxygenation (SiO2/FiO2:110 mm Hg). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with a moderate dose of intravenous corticosteroids and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. OUTCOMES: After the initiation of corticosteroids, the patient rapidly improved over the following 6 days. Serial chest computed tomography scans showed good absorption of the consolidations. The patient was discharged on Day 17 of hospitalization without obvious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Early use of moderate-dose corticosteroids over a short period may enhance recovery from COVID-19 in critically ill patients.",2020 Jul 31,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore, it does not meet the specified criteria.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the therapeutic response to corticosteroids in a critically ill COVID-19 patient, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the therapeutic response to corticosteroids in a critically ill COVID-19 patient, not complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
32750518,,Sustainable Effects of 8-Year Intermittent Spinal Cord Stimulation in a Patient with Thalamic Post-Stroke Pain.,Xu W||Zhang C||Sun B||Li D,"BACKGROUND: Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a central neuropathic pain syndrome secondary to a cerebrovascular accident. CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain. Long-term intermittent stimulation can preserve implantable pulse generator battery life and achieve sustained improvement of a patient's pain, movement, and affective mood status.",2020 Nov,20200801.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, focusing instead on spinal cord stimulation for post-stroke pain.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, focusing instead on spinal cord stimulation for post-stroke pain.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the effects of spinal cord stimulation on central post-stroke pain and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the effects of spinal cord stimulation on central post-stroke pain and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
32740318,,"Pembrolizumab-related Bilateral Ocular Hypotony, Uveitis, Cataracts, Exudative Retinal, and Choroidal Detachments: An Unusual Success Story.",Golash V||Almeida G,"Here, we report the presentation and management of a rare case of sight-threatening bilateral panuveitis with secondary chronic hypotony, subcapsular cataracts, exudative retinal detachments, and choroidal detachments, following initiation of pembrolizumab immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma. An 82-year-old white woman presented with painful, blurry vision 3 days after initiation of pembrolizumab immunotherapy. She had developed a marked panuveitis causing secondary hypotony. The fundal view was entirely limited by acutely dense cataracts and small, uveitic pupils unresponsive to topical dilation. Urgent cataract surgery with intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) was completed successfully and allowed a fundal examination. This revealed bilateral, symmetrical, inferior exudative retinal detachments, and choroidal detachments secondary to chronic hypotony. After 3 months of observation and cessation of oral steroids, the panuveitis remains quiescent, hypotony persists, and the choroidal and retinal detachments are showing progressive self-resolution. The current best-corrected visual acuity is 6/24 OU. She remains under close monitoring. The immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, has been reported to cause sight-threatening adverse effects. We report a rare case of profound bilateral complications treated successfully with oral and intravitreal steroids. To the authors' knowledge, this has not previously been reported in the literature. Ophthalmologists and oncologists should be aware of the ocular effects of pembrolizumab and be able to identify various complications early.

32703278,PMC7379825,Patient with rheumatoid arthritis with deep vein thrombosis presenting as a calf strain: a case report.,Lewis T,"BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis experience various comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease. More data and awareness exist regarding the adverse effects of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the arterial side of the cardiovascular system, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, than regarding adverse venous complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Rheumatoid arthritis affects more women than men, and the risk of venous thromboembolism in rheumatoid arthritis tends to increase with age; therefore, the presentation in this case report of deep vein thrombosis in a nonsmoking, young, fit man with rheumatoid arthritis is rare. This patient was sent away from a minor injuries unit with a diagnosis of a calf strain. Further assessment at an accident and emergency department later in the day confirmed deep vein thrombosis via ultrasonography. This case report underlines the need for vigilance because deep vein thrombosis is a risk factor in rheumatoid arthritis, even in young, male, and physically fit individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: A nonsmoking 39-year-old Caucasian man with a 2-year history of rheumatoid arthritis presented for assessment at a private physiotherapy clinic with a 4-week history of right-sided posterior calf pain that had developed following exercise at a gym. The patient therefore believed his symptoms were due to a calf strain. Findings at physiotherapy assessment suggested that the actual cause of the patient's symptoms were as a result of deep vein thrombosis. The patient was directed to a local minor injuries unit with a referral letter from the author outlining this diagnosis. Following clinical assessment at the minor injuries unit, the patient was told that there was no likelihood of deep vein thrombosis, and his diagnosis was a calf strain. The patient harbored concerns at this point and decided to seek further medical opinion at a nearby accident and emergency department, where deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed using ultrasonography, and the patient was commenced on anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: Venous thromboembolism risk in rheumatoid arthritis is stated as being less recognized as an arterial complication. This is borne out by this patient's clinical journey, wherein his youth, fitness, athletic appearance, and onset of symptoms during exercise were said to suggest a diagnosis of a calf strain at a minor injuries unit. Ultrasonography at a different accident and emergency unit later that day ultimately was used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis.",2020 Jul 24,20200724.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of deep vein thrombosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of deep vein thrombosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of deep vein thrombosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of deep vein thrombosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, which is unrelated to complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,95,,

To date, however, there is no established method of treatment. In this study, we investigated two patients with EDS to clarify the efficacy and safety of denosumab treatment in EDS patients with osteoporosis. We retrospectively enrolled two EDS patients with osteoporosis who underwent denosumab therapy. Patient 1 was a 59-year-old male with classical EDS and osteoporosis who received a 48-month course of denosumab therapy. His lumbar BMD and total hip BMD were 1.335 g/cm(2) and 0.762 g/cm(2) before treatment, respectively. Forty-eight months later, the lumbar and total hip BMD showed gains of 1.6% and 11.4%, respectively. Patient 2 was a 42-year-old male with vascular EDS and osteoporosis who received an 18-month course of denosumab therapy. His lumbar BMD and total hip BMD were 0.763 g/cm(2) and 0.583 g/cm(2) before treatment, respectively. Eighteen months later, the lumbar and total hip BMD showed gains of 5.0% and 1.8%, respectively. No fractures or other complications were recorded during the observational period in both cases. This is the first experience of denosmab therapy on patients with EDS and osteoporosis.

METHODS: We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. CASE-CENTERED RECOMMENDATIONS: Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. LIMITATIONS: Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.",2020 Sep 1,20200601.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the management of COVID-19 in patients with psychiatric disorders and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article focuses on the management of COVID-19 in patients with psychiatric disorders and does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the management of COVID-19 in patients with psychiatric disorders, focusing on pharmacological interactions and treatment recommendations, but does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the management of COVID-19 in patients with psychiatric disorders, focusing on pharmacological interactions and treatment recommendations, but does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,90,,

The key manifestations of nOH include lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness, and fatigue when standing and engaging in activities in the upright position and result in falls, impaired activities of living, decreased quality of life, and short-term cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis and treatment of nOH are necessary to mitigate its adverse effects and reduce nOH-related symptom burden. CASE STUDY: The management of nOH is illustrated through a case study. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Alerting providers about the impact and treatment of nOH, accurate measurement of orthostatic blood pressure, and educating patients and caregivers about nonpharmacological treatment options are important strategies to manage nOH. The goal of nOH treatment is to mitigate symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can play a crucial role in the recognition and management of nOH.

32616027,PMC7333273,Extremely elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level upon treatment with teriparatide: a case report.,Javinani A||Aghaei Meybodi HR||Kavosi H,"BACKGROUND: Teriparatide is a homolog of human parathyroid hormone (1-34), which is approved for the treatment of postmenopausal and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Several minor and transient side effects have been reported for teriparatide. However, controversial findings showed an increased risk of more significant adverse effects, including osteosarcoma in humans, although this finding has been demonstrated primarily in murine models. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 22-year-old Persian man with a previous history of systemic lupus erythematosus and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. He had a previous history of joint hypermobility, idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, mitral valve prolapse, and bilateral congenital inguinal hernia, which were probably compatible with an inherited connective tissue disease. He was treated with teriparatide for 7 months because of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. He was referred with a complaint of generalized bone pain and an extremely elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentration of 6480 U/L (normal range, 80-306). A whole-body bone scan revealed a diffuse increased osseous uptake. Furthermore, the patient's systemic lupus erythematosus was clinically inactive on the basis of laboratory findings during this period. The medication was discontinued, and the patient's serum alkaline phosphatase level began to decline. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an osteoblast hyperactivation state observed during treatment with teriparatide. It appears that the osteoblastogenic effect of teriparatide might induce this condition and, most likely, osteosarcoma in certain populations. However, the potential influence of the patient's young age, systemic lupus erythematosus, underlying inherited connective tissue disease, and medication use cannot be ignored.

Although definitive causation cannot be established in this case without additional studies, it is important to note that many targeted therapies have the potential to induce paradoxical effects, that is, the occurrence or exacerbation of pathologic conditions that have been shown to respond to these medications. Paradoxical findings with other targeted therapies include the occurrence of melanoma during treatment with BRAF inhibitors, keratoacanthomas with PD-1 inhibitors, vitiligo and psoriasis with TNF-alpha inhibitors, and hidradenitis suppurativa with various biologic agents.

SUMMARY: A 39-year-old Caucasian woman with longstanding epilepsy was initiated on topiramate therapy after experiencing a generalized seizure (she reported not taking any antiepileptic medication for years). Topiramate was started at a dosage of 25 mg by mouth twice daily and after 3 weeks titrated to a dosage of 100 mg by mouth twice daily for maintenance therapy. After initiation of topiramate therapy, the patient began to experience an immediate change in her carbonation perception when drinking carbonated beverages; all carbonated beverages, including seltzer and beer, tasted ""flat."" The patient remained on topiramate for the subsequent 12 months without her carbonation perception returning to normal but noted that drinking carbonated beverages through straws slightly mitigated the adverse effect. Case assessment using the adverse drug reaction probability scale of Naranjo et al indicated that topiramate was the probable cause of the patient's carbonation taste perversion.

Consequently, medical cannabis can also be provided for patients with complex PTSD who experience additional posttraumatic symptoms of affective dysregulation, negative perception of the self, and difficulties in relationships due to a history of repetitive trauma. In this article, we explore cannabis use in relation to benefits versus harms that might occur relative to specific complex PTSD symptoms and comorbidities. Whereas some symptoms related to PTSD per se (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, nightmares) may be benefited, others that are more characteristic of complex PTSD (e.g., dissociation, reckless behavior, and substance abuse associated with dysregulated affect) may be aggravated. Therefore, clinicians treating patients with complex PTSD who use or seek cannabis should carefully assess patients' motivations and the impacts of particular use patterns on specific symptoms. Clinicians and patients should be aware of and fully discuss the significant number of potential adverse effects of cannabis use, several of which might impede patients' participation in beneficial psychotherapeutic, social, and medical interventions.",2020 Aug,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses cannabis use in relation to PTSD and its potential benefits and harms, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to vaccinations against COVID-19.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses cannabis use in relation to PTSD and its potential benefits and harms, but it does not address complications or adverse effects specifically related to vaccinations against COVID-19.",2,90,,

Clinical manifestations include extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays, freckle-like pigmentation, ocular abnormalities, and an increased risk of developing neoplasms in sun-exposed areas of the skin, mucous membranes, and eyes. This paper describes the clinical outcome of pegylated interferon alpha 2b (PEG-IFN-alpha-2b) subconjunctival injections and topical mitomycin C (MMC) in the treatment of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in patients with XP. CASE REPORT A series of 3 patients with histopathologically-proven biopsy specimens of XP-associated neoplasia of the eyelids and ocular surface underwent subconjunctival injections of PEG-IFN-alpha-2 band topical cycles of MMC. There was a noticeable decrease in the size and severity of ocular surface squamous neoplasia, with minimal adverse effects of flu-like symptoms with mild fever and generalized malaise.

Lung transplantation remains the only viable treatment for patients with certain forms of this disease. Usage of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in veno-arterial form (VA-ECMO) after transplantation is both protective for left ventricle (enables adaptation to increased blood flow) and right ventricle (provides time to return to appropriate dimensions and in some cases to correct tricuspid regurgitaion). CASE PRESENTATION: The case study describes 4 patients who were treated with VA-ECMO as a perioperative support. Three patients were diagnosed with idiopathic form of precapillary primary pulmonary hypertension. A fourth patient was a 49-year old woman diagnosed with hypoplastic pulmonary veins representing the postcapillary form of pulmonary hypertension. In all of the cases, VA-ECMO was introduced during the surgery (femoral vein/internal jugular vein and femoral artery) and maintained for several days after the transplantation. Regular echocardiographic and biochemical assessment in postoperative course revealed that cardiac function improved during and after such treatment among all patients. They were successfully weaned off ECMO and finally surgically explanted without any local complications. One patient was treated with awake ECMO protocol. CONCLUSIONS: VA-ECMO was proved to be a useful tool during the transplantation and postoperative period. It helps to restore proper cardiac function, as well as prevent adverse effects of aforementioned pathologic changes of a heart.",2020 Sep,20200402.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the use of VA-ECMO in lung transplantation and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the use of VA-ECMO in lung transplantation and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,
32223791,,Pregabalin-induced sexual disinhibition.,Murphy R||McGuinness D||Hallahan B,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual side effects have rarely been reported secondary to treatment with Pregabalin, a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). METHOD: We present the case of AB, a 27-year-old single man with a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder who was prescribed pregabalin to alleviate the significant anxiety symptoms he was experiencing. RESULTS: A significant amelioration in anxiety symptoms was attained; however, he developed the adverse effects of acute sexual disinhibition and increased libido. These adverse effects were temporally related to treatment with pregabalin and reduced with dose reduction of this agent. CONCLUSIONS: To date, limited published data are available relating such a reaction to pregabalin. A greater clinical recognition of this association between pregabalin and sexual disinhibition, would allow clinicians to intervene at an earlier stage of this adverse effect and potentially as in this case, management may only require dose reduction rather than treatment discontinuation.",2020 Mar,20170308.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of pregabalin, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of pregabalin, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
32221859,PMC7220881,Clone-directed therapy for proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin depositions: is it always necessary? : Two case reports and literature review.,van Kruijsdijk RCM||Abrahams AC||Nguyen TQ||Minnema MC||Jacobs JFM||Limper M,"Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) encompasses a group of disorders in which a monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein) secreted by a B-cell or plasma cell clone causes renal disease. Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID) is a form of MGRS where M-protein is deposited in the glomerulus. Although evidence is limited, the current consensus is that therapy for PGNMID should be directed against the underlying clone. However, it is conceivable that there is heterogeneity in the renal prognosis of PGNMID and that not all patients have need for clone-directed therapy. Here, we report two cases of PGNMID with IgM-kappa gammopathy. In one case of a 53-year-old woman the glomerulonephritis resolved without clone-directed therapy. In the other case of a 34-year-old woman clone-directed therapy was discontinued due to adverse effects. Although no hematological response was achieved, the PGNMID resolved. In both cases there are no signs of a recurrent glomerulonephritis in over 3 years of follow-up. Here, we review the literature and suggest that some PGNMID patients have a favorable renal prognosis in whom clone-directed therapy can be withheld or postponed. Further research is warranted to yield predictors to identify these patients and to better understand the disease course of PGNMID.",2020 Jun,20200327.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses cases of proliferative glomerulonephritis related to monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses cases of proliferative glomerulonephritis related to monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits and does not address complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Recently, drug-associated PML is gaining attention as more cases of PML in connection with the use of various immunomodulatory drugs emerge. Over the last couple of years, sporadic reports have occurred about a possible association between PML and the use of a new immunomodulatory drug, ibrutinib (Imbruvica), primarily indicated for the treatment of various B-cell malignancies. CASE REPORT: Herein, we report a case of a 62-year-old female patient with bilateral mantle cell lymphoma of conjunctiva diagnosed at IVA clinical stage (according to the Ann Arbor staging of lymphomas) of the disease. As a first line of treatment, the patient was given 6 cycles of rituximab-based chemotherapy followed by a complete remission. Seven years later, the patient relapsed, at which point the treatment with ibrutinib was initiated. Three weeks after the initial dosage, the patient started to show signs of progressive neurological symptomatology and died 4 months thereafter due to bilateral bronchopneumonia. Due to unspecific MRI signs and negative PCR results, the diagnosis of PML was confirmed only postmortem. CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates a possible severe adverse effect of the immunomodulatory drug ibrutinib and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in its diagnosis. Since PML is a rare but highly fatal disease, it is of utmost importance to be aware of the possible connection with the use of this drug to prevent missed or delayed diagnosis, considering that timely therapeutic intervention is crucial for improved prognosis.",2020 Jun,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of the immunomodulatory drug ibrutinib in relation to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of the immunomodulatory drug ibrutinib in relation to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria for the scoring task.",2,90,,

32100141,,Changes in cone-driven functions after intravitreal aflibercept injections in patients with age-related macular degeneration.,Nishimura T||Machida S||Hara Y,"PURPOSE: To determine the changes in the cone-driven functions in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with intravitreal aflibercept. METHODS: We studied 44 eyes of 44 patients diagnosed with AMD whose mean age was 75 years. The contralateral unaffected eyes served as controls. All patients were initially treated with 3 consecutive monthly intravitreal aflibercept injections and thereafter with bimonthly injections for 12 months. Full-field cone electroretinograms (cone ERGs) were recorded at the baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after beginning the intravitreal aflibercept injections. The cone ERGs were elicited by red stimuli on a blue background. The focal macular ERGs (fmERGs) were elicited by 15 degrees white stimulus spot centered on the fovea. The amplitudes of the a- and b-waves, photopic negative response (PhNR), and sum of the oscillatory potentials (SigmaOPs, sum of OP1-3 amplitudes) were analyzed. In addition, the implicit times of the a- and b-waves were also analyzed. RESULTS: The amplitudes and implicit times of all components of the fmERGs were significantly improved compared to the baseline at 3 months after beginning the intravitreal aflibercept injections (P < 0.0005-0.05). The amplitudes of the a-waves and PhNRs were further increased during the maintenance phase (P < 0.005-0.01). On the other hand, the amplitudes of the full-field a-waves and PhNR of the cone ERGs were significantly reduced at 6 and 12 months compared to the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The macular function improved continuously during the maintenance phase of the intravitreal aflibercept injections.

METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study of stem cell and organ transplant recipients who received letermovir for the treatment of CMV infection from November 2017 to October 2018. RESULTS: Six patients were included, and 5 were evaluable. All received letermovir in the context of a refractory or resistant CMV infection including asymptomatic CMV viremia (n = 3), CMV syndrome (n = 1), and CMV pneumonitis and colitis (n = 1). The 3 asymptomatic patients experienced a decrease of the viral load (VL) to <200 IU/mL after letermovir therapy. One patient displayed a partial VL response (2-log of VL reduction) but a good clinical response, and one who received a suboptimal dose of letermovir experienced an increase of viremia.

CASE REPORT: The patient is a 39-year-old female, with a history of breast cancer and no known allergies, who was scheduled to start chemotherapy. While being administered fosaprepitant, she reported shortness of breath and was noted to be hypotensive and flushed. Two months later, the patient returned to clinic to start weekly paclitaxel. During the administration of the paclitxel test dose, the patient reported difficulty breathing, flushing, and chest tightness. Management and outcome: Both medication reactions were managed with epinephrine and other supportive medications. Fosaprepitant was taken out of the patient's antiemetic regimen for future cycles and paclitaxel was switched to nab-paclitaxel. DISCUSSION: It is well documented that paclitaxel and fosaprepitant have the potential to cause hypersensitivity reactions due to their excipients.

31914071,PMC6959895,Pneumocystis pneumonia after use of corticosteroids in a man with severe alcoholic hepatitis: A case report.,Chung MW||Kim UJ||Jun CH||Cho SB||Park SY||Park CH||Kim HS||Choi SK||Rew JS,"RATIONALE: Severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a very high mortality rate. Current guidelines recommend oral corticosteroids as first-line agents in individuals with severe AH to reduce short-term mortality. However, systemic corticosteroids have serious adverse effects. In individuals with AH, infection, which is one of the complications of steroid use, can result in serious outcomes, such as acute-on-chronic liver failure. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection which may occur when high-dose corticosteroids are prescribed for more than 1 month. Therefore, when high-dose corticosteroids are used, providing PCP prophylaxis is warranted. Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the drug of choice for the prophylaxis of PCP, its hepatotoxicity limits its use in patients with severe AH who are on high-dose corticosteroids. Moreover, there is a lack of consensus on which drugs should be used for PCP prophylaxis in individuals with severe AH who are on glucocorticoid treatment. Herein, we report a case of a 43-year-old male with fatal PCP that occurred after the use of corticosteroids for severe AH. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 43-year-old alcoholic man presented with a hematoma on his right leg. His liver function was poor, and he was he was diagnosed with severe AH and treated with oral corticosteroids for 26 days. After glucocorticoid treatment, he developed a productive cough. DIAGNOSES: A sputum PCR test was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii. INTERVENTIONS: He was initially treated with TMP-SMX and required artificial ventilation. OUTCOMES: He developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure, and died 10 days after starting TMP-SMX. LESSONS: To date, prevention of PCP in individuals with severe AH who are on corticosteroids has been overlooked. This case illustrates the need for prophylaxis of PCP in individuals with severe AH taking corticosteroids.",2020 Jan,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses complications related to corticosteroid use in a patient with severe alcoholic hepatitis, specifically focusing on Pneumocystis pneumonia, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses complications related to corticosteroid use in a patient with severe alcoholic hepatitis, specifically focusing on Pneumocystis pneumonia, rather than complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,90,,

Falsely reactive HIV screens have been reported in patients with various concomitant infectious and autoimmune conditions. Falsely positive confirmatory HIV differentiation assays are seen less frequently, but have been observed in cases of pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, and malaria. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 27 year-old man was referred after a reactive ADVIA Centaur(R) HIV Ag/Ab screen and positive Bio-Rad Geenius HIV 1/2 Confirmatory assay, suggesting HIV-1 infection. The patient's HIV viral load was undetectable prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and remained undetectable on subsequent testing after initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Both Centaur(R) and Geenius tests were repeated and returned reactive. As this patient was believed to be at low risk of acquiring HIV infection, samples were additionally run on Genscreen HIV-1 Ag assay and Fujirebio Inno-LIA HIV-1/2 score, with both returning non-reactive. For confirmation, the patient's proviral HIV DNA testing was negative, confirming the initial results as being falsely positive. The patient disclosed that he had been using a variety of anabolic steroids before and during the time of HIV testing. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The erroneous diagnosis of HIV can result in decreased quality of life and adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy if initiated, hence the importance of interpreting the results of HIV testing in the context of an individual patient.

However, RYGB could have some adverse effect in the mid and long term. Here, we describe simple technique for laparoscopic reversal of RYGB into normal anatomy. METHODS: The video shows our laparoscopic technique of the reversal of RYGB that was performed for severe protein deficiency. A 35-year-old woman with history of RYGB was referred to our center for restoration of normal digestive anatomy. RESULTS: A 35-year-old woman was managed for severe protein deficiency 3 years after RYGB. Renutrition was performed using peripherally inserted central catheter but nutritional status was dependent on PICC. No gastrostomy tube was implemented at the time where the patient was referred because the reversal of RYGB was decided. We found a modified RYGB with a common channel of 130 cm, an alimentary channel of 350 cm, and a biliopancreatic limb of 70 cm. Revision to normal digestive anatomy was performed using linear staplers, resection of 15 cm of the small bowel, and only one small bowel anastomosis. An uneventful post-operative course enabled rapid discharge (post-operative day 5). At 6-month follow-up, there was no more protein deficiency and the patient had acceptable weight regain. CONCLUSION: Reversal of RYGB is not usual and can be performed safely with few small bowel sacrifices. The optimization of pre-operative nutritional status is necessary to avoid complications.",2020 Mar,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19.

31848037,,Potential role of cannabidiol for seizure control in a patient with recurrent glioma.,Hsu K||Whitham E||Kichenadasse G,"Glioma-related epilepsy significantly impact on patients' quality of life, and can often be difficult to treat. Seizures cause significant morbidity for example neurocognitive deterioration, which may result from seizures themselves or due to adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs. Management of tumour with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may contribute to seizure control, but tumour related epilepsy is often refractory despite adequate treatment with standard anti-epileptic medications. Given the increasing interest in medicinal cannabis (or cannabidiol or CBD) as an anti-epileptic drug, CBD may help with seizure control in glioma patients with treatment-refractory seizures.

31847694,,A model for intervening with veterans and service members who are concerned about developing Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).,Belanger HG||Wortzel HS||Vanderploeg RD||Cooper DB,"OBJECTIVE: This paper briefly reviews what is unknown about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), highlights understandable concerns by individuals with a history of mild traumatic brain injuries who present to neuropsychologists with fears about a deteriorating course and eventual dementia due to CTE, and proposes a three-phased model for intervening with such individuals. METHOD: The proposed model includes three phases - (1) assessment and education, (2) targeted interventions for specific symptoms and comorbidities (e.g., sleep disturbance, headache, depression), and (3) psychotherapy to address mental health issues. While this is generally the order in which they will occur, the approach is not necessarily linear but rather provides a recommended schema. CONCLUSION: Media attention on concussion has greatly increased in the last several years, as interest in the possible contribution of concussion(s) to CTE grows. This media attention has some adverse effects in that it creates a false perception about the current state of the science and may engender iatrogenic effects.

Here, we describe a human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected patient with PBL that was refractory to conventional chemotherapies but was successfully controlled with a bortezomib-based regimen followed by a lenalidomide-based regimen. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old man suffered from nasal bleeding and occlusion. Whole-body computed tomography results revealed a large lesion occupying his nasal cavity. He was diagnosed with PBL based on a tumor biopsy and was treated with two lines of conventional chemotherapy. A dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH) regimen and an ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) regimen were ineffective, but the bortezomib-based regimen CyBorD (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide orally, and dexamethasone orally) provided a clinical response. Due to peripheral neuropathy, the patient was then treated with a lenalidomide-based regimen (Ld; lenalidomide and dexamethasone). Although a complete response was not achieved, the Ld regimen was tolerated and was continued with a partial response (PR) for over 2 years. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In the present case, PBL that was refractory to conventional chemotherapies responded to the CyBorD regimen and a long-term Ld-based regimen without severe adverse effects.

We report a patient with delusional parasitosis who consumed veterinary albendazole purchased on the Internet, leading to pancytopenia, transaminase elevation, and alopecia. A 53-year-old man was sent to the emergency department (ED) by his gastroenterologist because of abnormal laboratory results. The patient had chronic abdominal pain and believed he was infected with parasites. He purchased two bottles of veterinary-grade albendazole on the Internet, and over the 3 weeks before his ED visit, he consumed 113.6 g of albendazole (a normal maximal daily dose is 800 mg). Five days before admission, he noticed hair loss and a rash on his face. His examination was notable for significant scalp hair loss and hyperpigmentation along the jaw line. Laboratory studies were remarkable for pancytopenia (most notably a white blood cell count (WBC) of 0.4 x 10(3) cells/mm(3), with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0 x 10(3) cells/mm(3)) and transaminase elevation (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 268 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 89 IU/L).

31693498,,A rare case of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH) due to warfarin toxicity.,Borjian S||Hakkak N||Borjian MA,"INTRODUCTION: Warfarin is one of the most frequently used anticoagulant agents in the clinic. The most important adverse effect of warfarin is hemorrhage of vital organs, such as lung and brain. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare clinical condition which occurs due to variety of medical disorders. Although it's rarely reported, DAH can be a result of coagulopathy prompted by warfarin therapy. In this study we present a case of DAH, caused by warfarin toxicity which referred to the hospital with non-specific respiratory symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old female patient referred to the hospital complaining of shortness of breath, cough and dizziness. She had been taking warfarin due to mitral valve replacement for the past 10 years. Her recent symptoms began shortly after taking amoxicillin, a few days before admission. Early clinical examination and paraclinical studies reveal DAH as the cause of respiratory symptoms. The patient was then intubated and received fresh frozen plasma, packed cells and oral vitamin K. Laboratory findings apart from increased INR, PT, ESR and CRP were all within normal range. After the initiation of treatment patient's INR decreased and her clinical condition improved. Follow-up CT-Scan and bronchoscopy also confirmed resolving DAH. CONCLUSIONS: The usage of warfarin in anticoagulation should be closely monitored due to its narrow therapeutic window and other factors, including its interaction with other medications such as antibiotics. Warfarin toxicity can lead to DAH, a life-threatening condition which can be presented with non-specific symptoms and deteriorate patient's clinical condition in a short time. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to watch closely for primary symptoms of such rare incident in patients under warfarin therapy and initiate treatment as soon as possible, to prevent mortality.",2020 Mar 1,,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a case of warfarin-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses a case of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage due to warfarin toxicity, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses a case of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage due to warfarin toxicity, which is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccinations and their complications or adverse effects.",2,95,,

He was started on Linezolid 600 mg twice a day for 10 days by a local doctor possibly for some minor infection post hip surgery. He was in respiratory distress on arrival. Blood sugars showed severe hypoglycemia of 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L). He was admitted in intensive care unit and started on injectable antibiotics and 5% dextrose infusion and sugars were strictly monitored. His blood tests revealed severe hyponatremia with sodium level of 119 mEq/L and haemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 gm/dL, leucocytes of 6500/microL, platelets of 82 000/microL. The infection markers were normal throughout. The platelet count went progressively down from 82 000/microL on admission to 20 000/microL 2 days later; before it started rising back. Similarly there was drop in Hemoglobin and white cell counts. He required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressures. The blood sugar levels stabilized after the same. However patient had suffered acute lung injury secondary to aspiration and became NIV dependent and eventually passed away. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our case was unique in a way that our patient had adverse effects of linezolid like myelosuppression as well as the rare side effects of hypoglycemia at the same time. This combination of adverse events has never been described in the past to our knowledge. All the adverse effects responded to antibiotic de-challenge in our case. We had ruled out the possibility of other causes of Hypoglycemia such as sepsis, insulinoma, alcohol excess, malnutrition or hypoadrenalism. We searched the PubMed database and found four case reports out of which two were diabetics and other two were non diabetics. Out of 15 cases described by Vishwanathan et al only three cases were non diabetics. Our patient was non diabetic as well. Therefore our case is only the sixth reported case of hypoglycemia in non diabetic receiving Linezolid to our knowledge.",2020 Apr,20191028.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article focuses on the adverse effects of Linezolid, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2}","The article focuses on the adverse effects of Linezolid, not complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of Linezolid, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The article discusses the adverse effects of Linezolid, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

31359833,,Tamoxifen-induced vasculitis.,Kulkarni U||Nayak V||Prabhu MM||Rao R,"INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used widely for the treatment of breast cancer. Apart from its common adverse reactions such as endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, there are very few reports about its ability to cause vasculitis. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old woman who underwent modified radical mastectomy was started on tamoxifen. Six months later, she developed vasculitis which was confirmed by immunofluorescence-induced vasculitis in a pre-menopausal woman. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Dapsone was used to relieve her symptoms for two weeks, but the lesions reappeared when dapsone was stopped. She continues to suffer from vasculitis as tamoxifen could not be discontinued. DISCUSSION: This case report is important in order to draw attention towards this rare, but equally severe side effect of cutaneous vasculitis due to the most commonly used drug for breast cancer. In view of the absence of alternative medications for pre-menopausal women, it is necessary to have a strict monitoring of its adverse effects as well as more intensive research for a better agent.",2020 Apr,20190730.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a rare side effect of tamoxifen.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19; it focuses on a rare side effect of tamoxifen.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the adverse effects of tamoxifen, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses the adverse effects of tamoxifen, not vaccinations against COVID-19, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,

However, systemic corticosteroids could not be tapered because of recurrent ocular inflammation and systemic complications (diabetes mellitus, moon face, bone weakness), while CSC appeared in both eyes. A diagnosis of chronic VKH resistant to medications complicated by corticosteroid-induced CSC was made. Systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine were tapered and adalimumab initiated. Bilateral ocular inflammation and CSC were gradually reduced and visual acuity improved without any adverse effect. Twelve months after starting adalimumab monotherapy, no signs of active VKH and CSC were present.Conclusions: Adalimumab is one of the effective therapeutic options for refractory VKH disease complicated with corticosteroid-induced adverse effects.",2020 Apr 2,20190703.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on the treatment of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.', 'score': 2}","The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19, it focuses on the treatment of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.",2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses the efficacy of adalimumab in treating chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}",The article discusses the efficacy of adalimumab in treating chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and does not address complications or adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccinations.,2,95,,
31238794,PMC7016355,Selective brain hypothermia: feasibility and safety study of a novel method in five patients.,Seyedsaadat SM||Marasco SF||Daly DJ||McEgan R||Anderson J||Rodgers S||Kreck T||Kadirvel R||Kallmes DF,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Reduction of brain temperature remains the most common method of neuroprotection against ischemic injury employed during cardiac surgery. However, cooling delivered via the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is brief and cooling the body core along with the brain has been associated with a variety of unwanted effects. This study investigated the feasibility and safety of a novel selective brain cooling approach to induce rapid, brain-targeted hypothermia independent of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. METHODS: This first-in-human feasibility study enrolled five adults undergoing aortic valve replacement with cardiopulmonary bypass support. During surgery, the NeuroSave system circulated chilled saline within the pharynx and upper esophagus. Brain and body core temperature were continuously monitored. Adverse effects, cardiopulmonary function, and device function were noted. RESULTS: Patient 1 received cooling fluid for an insignificant period, and Patients 2-5 successfully underwent the cooling procedure using the NeuroSave system for 56-89 minutes. Cooling fluid was 12 degrees C for Patients 1-3, 6 degrees C for Patient 4, and 2 degrees C for Patient 5. There were no NeuroSave-related adverse events and no alterations in cardiopulmonary function during NeuroSave use. Brain temperature decreased by 3 degrees C within 15 minutes and remained at least 3.5 degrees C colder than the body core. During a brief episode of hypotension in one patient, the brain cooled an additional 4 degrees C in 2 minutes, briefly reaching 27.4 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The NeuroSave system can induce rapid brain-targeted hypothermia and simultaneously maintain a favorable body-brain temperature gradient, even during hypotension. Further studies are required to evaluate the function of the system during longer periods of use.",2020 Mar,20190626.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID19; therefore it does not meet the criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The input item discusses a study on selective brain hypothermia and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 95}","The input item discusses a study on selective brain hypothermia and does not address complications or adverse effects of vaccinations against COVID-19, therefore it does not meet the criteria.",2,95,,

Valsartan is well studied, but sacubitril has much left to understand. This report describes a 31-year-old African American female diagnosed with HFrEF who presented with a 7-day history of psychiatric symptoms following a dose increase in sacubitril/valsartan. Prior to the dose increase, the patient had no history of psychiatric diagnoses, but upon hospital presentation, family described instances of confabulation, paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep disturbances. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, ruling out infectious processes and illicit substance use. However, cranial computed tomography scans depicted intracranial volume loss abnormal for age with commensurate mild ventricular enlargement. Sacubitril/valsartan was discontinued inpatient, symptoms resolved, and the medication intolerance was documented.

30909794,,Nivolumab-induced hepatitis: A rare side effect of an immune check point inhibitor.,Mathew Thomas V||Bindal P||Ann Alexander S||McDonald K,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have ushered in a new era in cancer management. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) activity by binding to the PD-1 receptor. This inhibits suppression of the T-cell activity, which can in turn cause increased killing of cancer cells. This alteration in the activity of the T cells can cause them to lose their ability to identify host cells and leads to immune-related adverse effects (irAE). Nivolumab-induced hepatotoxicity is rare and accounts for 3-6% of all irAE. We present a case of nivolumab-induced hepatitis. A woman who was treated for recurrent renal cell carcinoma presented with hepatitis. Workup for other causes was negative and the hepatitis was attributed to the administration of nivolumab. She was started on oral steroids followed which she initially improved. However, she later presented with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to gastroduodenal ulcers and subsequently developed acute tubular necrosis and passed from the complications. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have proven to be a promising approach in the management of a wide array of neoplasms by immunomodulation. As these agents are becoming standard of therapy in the management of cancers, a heightened vigilance in the diagnosis of irAE is warranted. With heightened vigilance, early recognition can lead to decreased mortality and morbidity.",2020 Mar,20190325.0,"{'certainty': 100, 'reasoning': 'The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.', 'score': 2}",The article does not discuss complications or adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations; therefore it does not meet the specified criteria.,2,100,"{'reasoning': 'The article discusses nivolumab-induced hepatitis, which is related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, not COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.', 'score': 2, 'certainty': 90}","The article discusses nivolumab-induced hepatitis, which is related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, not COVID-19 vaccinations, thus it does not meet the criteria.",2,90,,
