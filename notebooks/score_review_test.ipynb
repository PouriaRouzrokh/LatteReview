      "        Abstract: Although significant research efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the safety of large language models (LLMs) by understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks, evaluating the defense capabilities of LLMs against jailbreak attacks also attracts lots of attention. Current evaluation methods lack explainability and do not generalize well to complex scenarios, resulting in incomplete and inaccurate assessments (e.g., direct judgment without reasoning explainability, the F1 score of the GPT-4 judge is only 55% in complex scenarios and bias evaluation on multilingual scenarios, etc.). To address these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, JAILJUDGE, which includes a wide range of risk scenarios with complex malicious prompts (e.g., synthetic, adversarial, in-the-wild, and multi-language scenarios, etc.) along with high-quality humanannotated test datasets. Specifically, the JAILJUDGE dataset comprises training data of JAILJUDGE, with over 35k+ instruction-tune training data with reasoning explainability, and JAILJUDGETEST, a 4.5k+ labeled set of broad risk scenarios and a 6k+ labeled set of multilingual scenarios in ten languages. To provide reasoning explanations (e.g., explaining why an LLM is jailbroken or not) and fine-grained evaluations (jailbroken score from 1 to 10), we propose a multi-agent jailbreak judge framework, JailJudge MultiAgent, making the decision inference process explicit and interpretable to enhance evaluation quality. Using this framework, we construct the instruction-tuning ground truth and then instruction-tune an end-to-end jailbreak judge model, JAILJUDGE Guard, which can also provide reasoning explainability with fine-grained evaluations without API costs. Additionally, we introduce JailBoost, an attacker-agnostic attack enhancer, and GuardShield, a safety moderation defense method, both based on JAILJUDGE Guard. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our JAILJUDGE benchmark and jailbreak judge methods. Our jailbreak judge methods (JailJudge MultiAgent and JAILJUDGE Guard) achieve SOTA performance in closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) and safety moderation models (e.g., Llama-Guard and ShieldGemma, etc.), across a broad range of complex behaviors (e.g., JAILJUDGE benchmark, etc.) to zero-shot scenarios (e.g., other open data, etc.). Importantly, JailBoost and Guard- Shield, based on JAILJUDGE Guard, can enhance downstream tasks in jailbreak attacks and defenses under zero-shot settings with significant improvement (e.g., JailBoost can increase the average performance by approximately 29.24%, while GuardShield can reduce the average defense ASR from 40.46% to 0.15%).\n",

      "        Title: An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval\n",
      "        Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based on the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a Python program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org, weather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.\n",

      "        Abstract: Collective behavior occurs ubiquitously in nature and it plays a key role in bacterial colonies, mammalian cells or flocks of birds. Here, we examine the average density and velocity of self-propelled particles, which are described by a system of partial differential equations near the flocking transition of the Vicsek model. This agent-based model illustrates the trend towards flock formation of animals that align their velocities to an average of those of their neighbors. Near the flocking transition, particle density and velocity obey partial differential equations that include a parameter ε measuring the distance to the bifurcation point. We have obtained analytically the Riemann invariants in one and two spatial dimensions for the hyperbolic (ε = 0) and parabolic (ε 6= 0) system and, under periodic initial-boundary value conditions, we show that the solutions include wave trains. Additionally, we have found wave trains having oscillation frequencies that agree with those predicted by a linearization approximation and that may propagate at angles depending on the initial condition. The wave amplitudes increase with time for the hyperbolic system but are stabilized to finite values for the parabolic system. To integrate the partial differential equations, we design a basic numerical scheme which is first order in time and space. To mitigate numerical dissipation and ensure good resolution of the wave features, we also use a high order accurate WENO5 reconstruction procedure in space and a third order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme in time. Comparisons with direct simulations of the Vicsek model confirm these predictions.\n",

      "        Abstract: We propose Embodied AI (E-AI) as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields (philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics) to highlight how E-AI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. By broadening the scope of E-AI, we introduce a theoretical framework based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston’s active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to E-AI development. Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware, persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future E-AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating E-AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest for AGI.\n",

      "        Title: Individual Variation Affects Outbreak Magnitude and Predictability in an Extended Multi-Pathogen SIR Model of Pigeons Vising Dairy Farms\n",
      "        Abstract: Zoonotic disease transmission between animals and humans is a growing risk and the agricultural context acts as a likely point of transition, with individual heterogeneity acting as an important contributor. Livestock often occurs at high local densities, facilitating spread within sites (e.g. among cows in a dairy farm), while wildlife is often more mobile, potentially connecting spatially isolated sites. Thus, understanding the dynamics of disease spread in the wildlife-livestock interface is crucial for mitigating these risks of transmission. Specifically, the interactions between pigeons and in-door cows at dairy farms can lead to significant disease transmission and economic losses for farmers; putting livestock, adjacent human populations, and other wildlife species at risk. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-pathogen model with continuous spatial movement. The model expands on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) framework and accounts for both within-species and cross-species transmission of pathogens, as well as the exploration-exploitation movement dynamics of pigeons, which play a critical role in the spread of infection agents. In addition to model formulation, we also implement it as an agent-based simulation approach and use empirical field data to investigate different biologically realistic scenarios, evaluating the effect of various parameters on the epidemic spread. Namely, in agreement with theoretical expectations, the model predicts that the heterogeneity of the pigeons’ movement dynamics can drastically affect both the magnitude and stability of outbreaks. In addition, joint infection by multiple pathogens can have an interactive effect unobservable in single-pathogen SIR models, reflecting a non-intuitive inhibition of the outbreak. Our findings highlight the impact of heterogeneity in host behavior on their pathogens and allow realistic predictions of outbreak dynamics in the multi-pathogen wildlife-livestock interface with consequences to zoonotic diseases in various systems.\n",

      "        Title: Agent-based modeling predicts HDL-independent pathway of removal of excess surface lipids from very low density lipoprotein\n",
      "        Abstract: A hallmark of the metabolic syndrome is low HDL-cholesterol coupled with high plasma triglycerides (TG), but it is unclear what drives this close association. Plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol are thought to communicate through two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, excess surface lipids from VLDL released during lipolysis are transferred to HDL, thereby contributing to HDL directly but also indirectly through providing substrate for LCAT. Secondly, high plasma TG increases clearance of HDL through core-lipid exchange between VLDL and HDL via CETP and subsequent hydrolysis of the TG in HDL, resulting in smaller HDL and thus increased clearance rates. To test our understanding of how high plasma TG induces low HDL-cholesterol, making use of established knowledge, we developed a comprehensive agent-based model of lipoprotein metabolism which was validated using monogenic disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. By perturbing plasma TG in the model, we tested whether the current theoretical framework reproduces experimental findings. Interestingly, while increasing plasma TG through simulating decreased lipolysis of VLDL resulted in the expected decrease in HDL cholesterol, perturbing plasma TG through simulating increased VLDL production rates did not result in the expected HDL-TG relation at physiological lipid fluxes. However, model perturbations and experimental findings can be reconciled if we assume a pathway removing excess surface-lipid from VLDL that does not contribute to HDL cholesterol ester production through LCAT. In conclusion, our model simulations suggest that excess surface lipid from VLDL is cleared in part independently from HDL.\n",

      "        Abstract: Humans tend to give more weight to information confirming their beliefs than to information that disconfirms them. Nevertheless, this apparent irrationality has been shown to improve individual decision-making under uncertainty. However, little is known about this bias’ impact on collective decision-making. Here, we investigate the conditions under which confirmation bias is beneficial or detrimental to collective decision-making. To do so, we develop a Collective Asymmetric Reinforcement Learning (CARL) model in which artificial agents observe others’ actions and rewards, and update this information asymmetrically. We use agent-based simulations to study how confirmation bias affects collective performance on a two-armed bandit task, and how resource scarcity, group size and bias strength modulate this effect. We find that a confirmation bias benefits group learning across a wide range of resource-scarcity conditions. Moreover, we discover that, past a critical bias strength, resource abundance favors the emergence of two different performance regimes, one of which is suboptimal. In addition, we find that this regime bifurcation comes with polarization in small groups of agents. Overall, our results suggest the existence of an optimal, moderate level of confirmation bias for collective decision-making.\n",

      "        Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate interactions between autonomous agents in constrained environments over time. ABMs are often used for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. In order to simulate disease outbreaks or other phenomena, ABMs rely on “synthetic ecosystems,” or information about agents and their environments that is representative of the real world. Previous approaches for generating synthetic ecosystems have some limitations: they are not open-source, cannot be adapted to new or updated input data sources, and do not allow for alternative methods for sampling agent characteristics and locations. We introduce a general framework for generating Synthetic Populations and Ecosystems of the World (SPEW), implemented as an open-source R package. SPEW allows researchers to choose from a variety of sampling methods for agent characteristics and locations when generating synthetic ecosystems for any geographic region. SPEW can produce synthetic ecosystems for any agent (e.g. humans, mosquitoes, etc), provided that appropriate data is available. We analyze the accuracy and computational efficiency of SPEW given different sampling methods for agent characteristics and locations and provide a suite of diagnostics to screen our synthetic ecosystems. SPEW has generated over five billion human agents across approximately 100,000 geographic regions in about 70 countries, available online.\n",

      "        Abstract: Compartmental models are a tool commonly used in epidemiology for the mathematical modelling of the spread of infectious diseases, with their most popular representative being the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model and its derivatives. However, current SIR models are bounded in their capabilities to model government policies in the form of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and weather effects and offer limited predictive power. More capable alternatives such as agent based models (ABMs) are computationally expensive and require specialized hardware. We introduce a neural network augmented SIR model that can be run on commodity hardware, takes NPIs and weather effects into account and offers improved predictive power as well as counterfactual analysis capabilities. We demonstrate our models improvement of the state-of-the-art modeling COVID-19 in Austria during the 03.2020 to 03.2021 period and provide an outlook for the future up to 01.2024.\n",
